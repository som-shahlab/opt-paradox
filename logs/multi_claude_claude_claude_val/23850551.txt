HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This patient is a ___ year old female who complains of N/V/D. Patient with multiple episodes of vomiting and diarrhea. Patient notes + abd pain, constant x 1 day. No blood in vomit or stool. Abdominal pain is diffuse but worse at right lower quadrant. No sick contacts. No recent travel. No unusual food.                           Past Medical History: migraine, hysterectomy    Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the presentation of acute abdominal pain (worse in RLQ), vomiting, and diarrhea, I need to first perform a physical examination to assess the abdomen and vital signs. This will help differentiate between gastroenteritis, appendicitis, and other abdominal conditions.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: vital signs, abdominal examination (inspection, auscultation, palpation, rebound tenderness, McBurney's point tenderness), skin turgor assessment, capillary refill

ToolMessage:

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the RLQ tenderness and symptoms, I need to order laboratory tests to evaluate for inflammatory markers, infection, and assess hydration status. The physical exam shows tenderness without rebound or guarding, but we need to rule out appendicitis and assess severity of the condition.
Action: laboratory tests

}

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the RLQ tenderness and elevated WBC (14.1), even though there's no rebound tenderness, we should obtain imaging to evaluate for possible appendicitis or other intra-abdominal pathology. The labs show mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia, suggesting an inflammatory/infectious process. Electrolytes show mild hyponatremia, likely due to fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast report, which matches your request. Here is the complete report:  CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained from the base of the lungs to pubic symphysis after administration of 130 cc of Optiray nonionic intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were prepared and reviewed.  FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The visualized lung bases are clear. The visualized heart is normal without pericardial effusion. In the right lower quadrant, there is a 12 mm blind-ending tubular structure in the expected region of the appendix with surrounding inflammatory changes and a hyperdense focus at the proximal portion consistent with an appendicolith (300B:31, 2:55, 300B:29). These findings are suggestive of acute uncomplicated ____. There are no drainable collections. There is no evidence of free air. Otherwise, the stomach and the remainder of the visualized loops of small and large bowel are normal. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There is a tiny subcentimeter hypodensity in the interpolar region of the left kidney (2:24) which is too small to characterize. Otherwise, bilateral kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete promptly and are within normal limits. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber and contour. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder, rectum, and sigmoid colon are normal. The uterus is not definitely visualized and may be atrophic or absent. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: I now have sufficient information to complete the clinical data collection. The patient presented with N/V/D and RLQ abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed RLQ tenderness without rebound or guarding. Laboratory studies showed leukocytosis (WBC 14.1) with neutrophilia (78.3%) and mild hyponatremia (Na 134). Most significantly, the CT abdomen/pelvis revealed a 12mm appendix with surrounding inflammatory changes and an appendicolith, confirming the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. No complications such as perforation or abscess were noted. The combination of clinical presentation, laboratory findings showing inflammation, and definitive imaging confirms acute uncomplicated appendicitis requiring surgical consultation.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

Thought: The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results provide a clear diagnostic picture. The patient presents with RLQ pain, elevated WBC (14.1), and CT findings of a 12mm blind-ending tubular structure with surrounding inflammation and an appendicolith, which is diagnostic of acute appendicitis. The vomiting and diarrhea are likely related symptoms. The absence of rebound tenderness doesn't rule out appendicitis, as the presentation can be variable. The mild hyponatremia and trace blood in urinalysis are likely secondary findings.

   - Prophylactic antibiotics: Cefoxitin 2g IV or Cefotetan 2g IV within 60 minutes before surgery
   
3. Pain management:
   - Morphine 4-8mg IV PRN for severe pain
   
4. Post-operative care:
   - Early mobilization
   - Diet advancement as tolerated
