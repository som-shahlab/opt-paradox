Patient History:
The patient is a ___ year old woman with stage IV Hodgkin's  disease on BEACOPP s/p first cycle ___, due for cycle 2  tomorrow who p/w abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Her last  chemo infusion was ___ with Bleomycin and vincristine which she  tolerated well. She also has a h/o DVT in R arm from a PICC,  which was pulled and she has been treated w/ Lovenox. She  underwent Port placement today w/o any complications. This  afternoon, she developed diffuse abdominal pain, back pain, body  aches, "bone discomfort", and CP as well as nausea and vomiting.  All complaints started after awakening from a nap. She had clam  chowder after port placement and then went home to take nap.  Upon awakening she felt pain in her back similar to her Neupogen  pain. She could not get comfortable and took an oxycodone  without relief. Shortly after she developed nausea which did not  improve with ativan and then she began vomiting, initially  indigested food which became bilious. She denies any blood or  coffee grounds. She notes her stomach feels distended and  uncomfortable but not painful. She notes no fevers but did have  chills and sweats upon awakening today. Denies cough, diarrhea,  or sick contacts. No pain at port site.   .   In the ED, vitals significant for tachycardia without  hypotension. Lactate normal. WBC 21.5, down from 37.7, L shifted  with 3% bands and 1% atypicals. U/A and CXR unremarkable. ECG  unchanged. CTA negative. She received morphine 4 mg x 2 and  Zofran. She continues to have chest and back discomfort. She  received 1 LNS. Tachycardia persisted despite hypertension.   .      Past Medical History: Past Medical/Surgical history:  # Hodgkin's disease   # hypertension   # hyperlipidemia   # h/o PICC associated DVT on lovenox   # s/p ERCP and stent placement for biliary obstruction d/t LAD   .   Oncologic history:  Mrs. ___ is a ___ female who was in her usual state  of health until early ___ when she developed an  "unrelenting" dry cough. She was treated with azithromycin and  Robitussin with codeine for presumed bronchitis. At that time,  she denied fevers, chills, or night sweats and her appetite and  weight were stable. She completed treatment with azithromycin  and Robitussin in early ___. After treatment, the cough had  improved but had not completely resolved. She developed fatigue  and malaise. Her colleagues described her as   pale. She began her summer vacation on ___ and was so  fatigued that she was sleeping 16 hours a day. Her stomach had  become distended and uncomfortable.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's presentation with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and recent port placement, along with her history of Hodgkin's lymphoma on chemotherapy, we need to:
1. Evaluate for acute abdomen
2. Rule out port-related complications
3. Assess for infection given her immunocompromised state
4. Check for metabolic derangements

Let's start with a focused physical examination.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: vital signs, abdominal examination, port site inspection, cardiopulmonary examination, musculoskeletal back examination

Thought: Given the physical exam findings of RLQ/RUQ tenderness and mild distension, along with tachycardia and recent chemotherapy, we need to:
1. Evaluate for acute abdominal pathology (appendicitis, typhlitis)
2. Check inflammatory markers
3. Assess liver function given her history of biliary issues
4. Check for electrolyte imbalances that could be causing symptoms
Action: laboratory tests

Thought: Given the physical exam findings of RLQ/RUQ tenderness and the lab results showing leukocytosis with bandemia, we need abdominal imaging to evaluate for potential causes such as neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis), appendicitis, or other intra-abdominal processes.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the full report for CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced MDCT-acquired axial images of the abdomen and pelvis from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis. Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.  FINDINGS: The lung bases show small bilateral pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. The liver shows no focal lesion. There is mild dilatation of the central intrahepatic biliary ducts. A CBD stent is in place with proximal tip located at the confluence of the intrahepatic ducts and the distal portion in the duodenum. A percutaneous ____ is appropriately situated with tip coiled in the fundus of the gallbladder. The gallbladder contains tiny locules of air, which is not unexpected. The extent of gallbladder wall thickening/edema and pericholecystic fluid is is probably unchanged from prior ultrasound, allowing for difference in technique. No discrete area of wall hypoenhancement is seen to suggest necrosis.  The spleen is lobulated and heterogenous, which correlates with lymphomatous involvment on PET CT. The adrenal glands and right kidney are normal. The left kidney contains two hypoattenuating foci, the largest of which measures 3.2 x 3.0 cm and most consistent with a cyst. The smaller of these lesions is incompletely characterized. The pancreas enhances homogeneously without focal lesion. Apparent focus of hypoattenuation in the pancreatic head (series 2, image 34) likely represents volume averaging of the adjacent duodenum. The abdominal aorta maintains a normal caliber and contour. The celiac artery, SMA, and ___ are patent. Confluent soft tissue in the porta hepatis and in the retroperitoneum surrounding the celiac axis and aorta is consistent with known lymphoma. Multiple small mesenteric lymph nodes are present. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pericolic gutters and surrounding the liver. There is no free air.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, uterus and adnexa are within normal limits. Small amount of pelvic free fluid is nonhemorrhagic. Multiple small lymph nodes are identified in the bilateral iliac chain and left external iliac chain.  BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is identified."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: I now have enough information to complete my assessment. The patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting in the setting of recent chemotherapy and port placement. Key findings include:

1. Physical exam shows RLQ/RUQ tenderness with mild abdominal distention
2. Labs reveal:
   - Significant leukocytosis (WBC 21.5) with left shift and bandemia
   - Mild anemia (Hgb 10.2)
   - Normal liver function tests and lipase
3. CT abdomen/pelvis shows:
   - Small bilateral pleural effusions
   - Mild intrahepatic biliary duct dilation with CBD stent in place
   - Known lymphomatous involvement of spleen and lymph nodes
   - Small amount of free fluid
   - No acute inflammatory process, perforation, or obstruction

The presentation is most consistent with chemotherapy-related toxicity and possibly early neutropenic enterocolitis, though the imaging doesn't show typical findings of typhlitis. The workup has been sufficient to rule out acute surgical abdomen, port-related complications, and other acute processes.
Action: done
