HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ yo F w/ no PMH who yesterday started having vague abdominal pain, continued to eat normally. Later last night, she started having worse pain and had some n/v (NBNB), and then the pain localized to RLQ. Denies fevers, chills, sweats, SOB, dysuria, radiation of pain, ovarian problems, or any other symptoms. She denies any prior sexually transmitted infections or PID, and she is currently on her period.   Past Medical History: PMH: none PSH: none Meds: OCP   Social History: ___ Family History: FH: no history of UC or crohn's


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the presentation of RLQ pain with nausea/vomiting, need to evaluate for appendicitis and other causes of acute abdominal pain. Important to perform a focused physical examination first, particularly of the abdomen and pelvis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: vital signs, abdominal inspection, abdominal palpation, McBurney's point tenderness, psoas sign, obturator sign, Rovsing's sign, rebound tenderness, pelvic examination

ToolMessage:
"VS 98.5 73 101/52 18 100RA Gen: AAOx3 HEENT: NCAT, PERRLA, EOMI, mucosa pink, no LAD CV: RRR no mrg Pulm: CTA ___, no w/r/c Abd: s/nt/nd; bsx4; inc: c/d/i ext: no c/c/e; +2 pulses"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The physical exam shows normal vitals but is not complete enough to evaluate the abdominal findings specifically for appendicitis. Need laboratory tests to assess for infection/inflammation and to rule out pregnancy given patient is of reproductive age.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, lipase, urinalysis with microscopy, urine pregnancy test, CRP, ESR

ToolMessage:

}

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the elevated WBC count with neutrophilic predominance, negative pregnancy test, normal lipase, and normal urinalysis, along with the clinical presentation of RLQ pain, we should proceed with imaging to evaluate for appendicitis. CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast would be most appropriate given the clinical scenario.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is not available in the provided list of imaging studies.  The only available imaging study is an ultrasound of the appendix."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Let's proceed with ultrasound as the initial imaging study, which is appropriate especially given the patient's young age and can help evaluate for appendicitis while avoiding radiation exposure. Ultrasound can also help evaluate for other pelvic pathology given patient is female and menstruating.
Action: imaging
Action Input: appendix ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"US APPENDIX (Ultrasound):  EXAMINATION: US APPENDIX  TECHNIQUE: Grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound images were obtained at the patient's area of discomfort.  FINDINGS: The appendix is noncompressible and dilated, measuring up to 1.1 x 1.1 cm (transverse). There is an appendicolith measuring 6 mm. There is no evidence of periappendiceal fluid collection.  This matches your request for an appendix ultrasound."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Based on the complete evaluation, I can now provide a comprehensive clinical assessment. The patient presents with classic symptoms of appendicitis: initial periumbilical pain localizing to RLQ, associated with nausea/vomiting. The laboratory findings show significant leukocytosis (WBC 18.0) with neutrophilic predominance (87.1%), suggesting acute inflammation. Most importantly, the ultrasound findings are diagnostic for acute appendicitis, showing:
1. Dilated, noncompressible appendix (>1.0 cm)
2. Presence of an appendicolith
3. No evidence of perforation
Other important conditions have been ruled out:
- Negative pregnancy test rules out ectopic pregnancy
- Normal lipase rules out pancreatitis
- Normal urinalysis rules out UTI/pyelonephritis
No further diagnostic testing is needed as we have confirmed the diagnosis of acute, uncomplicated appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The clinical presentation strongly suggests acute appendicitis, supported by:
1. Classic migration of pain to RLQ
2. Associated nausea/vomiting
3. Elevated WBC (18.0) with neutrophilia (87.1%)
4. Ultrasound findings of:
   - Dilated appendix >1cm (1.1cm)
   - Noncompressible appendix
   - Presence of appendicolith
Other diagnoses considered but less likely given imaging and lab findings include ovarian cyst, PID, mesenteric adenitis, and gastroenteritis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Cyst/Hemorrhagic Cyst
3. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
4. Mesenteric Adenitis
5. Gastroenteritis

Treatment:
1. NPO status
2. IV fluid resuscitation with normal saline
3. Surgical consultation for laparoscopic appendectomy
4. Preoperative antibiotics:
   - Cefoxitin 2g IV or
   - Cefazolin 2g IV + Metronidazole 500mg IV
5. Pain management with morphine 4mg IV PRN
6. Antiemetics (ondansetron 4mg IV PRN)
7. Perioperative risk assessment and preoperative evaluation
8. Informed consent for surgery
9. Post-operative care:
   - Early mobilization
   - Diet advancement as tolerated
   - Wound care instructions
   - Follow-up appointment in 1-2 weeks
