InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the concerning findings of acute renal failure, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, and low tacrolimus levels in a transplant recipient, along with abdominal pain and recent MRI mention, we should obtain imaging to evaluate the transplanted kidney and pancreas.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast, Renal ultrasound with doppler of transplanted kidney

ToolMessage:
"While a CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast is requested, this study is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. The only available studies are a liver/gallbladder ultrasound and a renal transplant ultrasound.  For the second requested study (renal ultrasound with doppler of transplanted kidney), I can provide the matching report:  RENAL TRANSPLANT U.S. (Ultrasound): RENAL TRANSPLANT ULTRASOUND: The transplanted kidney in the right lower quadrant measures 11.7 cm with stable mild hydronephrosis. There is a small amount of perinephric fluid; however, there is also ascites in all four quadrants. Thickening of the bladder wall is unchanged. Doppler examination of the transplanted kidney demonstrates normal arterial and venous waveforms in the main renal artery and vein. Resistive indices within the upper, mid and lower poles are 0.78, 0.83 and 0.79 respectively, which are elevated and increased compared to the prior exam."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: I now have enough information to complete my assessment. The patient presents with acute renal failure (Cr 6.4, up from baseline) in the setting of kidney transplant with multiple concerning findings:
1. Elevated resistive indices on renal transplant ultrasound suggesting possible rejection
2. Low tacrolimus level (5.8) indicating subtherapeutic immunosuppression
3. Metabolic derangements including hyperkalemia (5.7), metabolic acidosis (bicarb 15)
4. Urinalysis showing proteinuria and casts suggesting intrinsic renal damage
5. Presence of ascites and perinephric fluid on ultrasound
6. Previous history of humoral rejection
7. Initially elevated lipase at OSH (363) has now normalized (90)
8. Chronic abdominal pain with recent negative imaging findings

The constellation of findings strongly suggests acute transplant rejection (likely due to subtherapeutic tacrolimus levels) with resolved pancreatitis. No further diagnostic testing is needed at this time as the clinical picture is clear enough to proceed with treatment.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: This is a complex case of acute renal failure in a transplant recipient with multiple concerning features. The elevated resistive indices on renal ultrasound, low tacrolimus level, and acute kidney injury suggest possible acute rejection. The patient also has significant metabolic derangements (hyperkalemia, acidosis), volume overload (bilateral leg edema, ascites), and abdominal pain. While initial lipase was elevated at OSH (363), it has now normalized (90), suggesting resolving pancreatitis. The hydronephrosis and ascites on ultrasound could be contributing to the renal dysfunction.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute kidney transplant rejection (elevated resistive indices, low tacrolimus level, acute kidney injury)
2. Acute tubular necrosis
3. Resolving acute pancreatitis
4. Volume overload with ascites and peripheral edema
5. Metabolic acidosis with hyperkalemia secondary to acute kidney injury

Treatment:
1. Immediate management:
   - Admit to transplant unit
   - Urgent nephrology consultation
   - Correct hyperkalemia (calcium gluconate, insulin/dextrose, sodium bicarbonate)
   - Consider urgent dialysis if no improvement

2. Rejection management:
   - High-dose methylprednisolone (500mg-1g IV daily for 3-5 days)
   - Optimize tacrolimus dosing to achieve therapeutic levels
   - Consider plasmapheresis if antibody-mediated rejection suspected

3. Supportive care:
   - Careful fluid management with strict I/Os
   - Daily weights
   - Low potassium diet
   - Continue pain management with oral dilaudid
   - DVT prophylaxis

4. Monitoring:
   - Daily BMP, CBC, tacrolimus levels
   - Serial physical exams
   - Strict vital sign monitoring
   - Daily weight checks
   - Regular assessment of urine output

5. Additional workup:
   - Transplant kidney biopsy (after coagulation parameters checked)
   - BK virus and CMV PCR
   - Donor-specific antibodies
   - Blood cultures if febrile
