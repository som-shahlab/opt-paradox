HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This is an otherwise healthy ___ year-old female with a one-day history of abdominal pain. Patient reports having felt mild periumbilical discomfort last night that migrated to the right lower quadrant earlier this morning and became sharp, of  moderate intensity (___), non-radiated, with no known alleviating factors, worsened with movements. Concomitantly, she endorsed intermittent nausea but no emesis, as well as headache. She denies fever, chills.    Past Medical History: Migraines    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a one-day history of abdominal pain that migrated from the periumbilical area to the right lower quadrant, which is a classic symptom of appendicitis. The pain is described as sharp and moderate in intensity, worsened by movement, and accompanied by nausea and headache. The patient's past medical history of migraines could be relevant, but it is not directly related to the current symptoms. The lack of fever and chills is notable, but it does not rule out appendicitis. To further evaluate the patient, I need to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count, which could indicate that the patient may not have a significant infection or inflammatory process. However, the absence of fever and chills does not rule out appendicitis. The liver function tests are within normal limits, and the lipase level is normal, which makes pancreatitis less likely. The urinalysis results show a hazy appearance and the presence of leukocytes, which could indicate a urinary tract infection, but the patient's symptoms do not strongly suggest this diagnosis. To further evaluate the patient's abdominal pain, I need to order imaging studies.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Ultrasound,\" is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. However, the requested \"Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  **TECHNIQUE:** Contiguous axial multidetector CT images through the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformations. Total DLP: 425 mGy-cm  **FINDINGS:**  - **Lung bases:** Partially imaged lung bases are notable for minimal atelectasis; otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion. The cardiac apex is unremarkable.    - **CT abdomen:** The liver enhances homogeneously without concerning lesions or biliary dilatation. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are within normal limits. The kidneys enhance and excrete symmetrically without concerning lesions or hydronephrosis. Stomach and loops of small bowel are largely decompressed. Colon is unremarkable. The appendix is fluid-filled measures up to 7 mm and demonstrates mild wall thickening and mild adjacent fat stranding (2:50, 601b:23). There is no extraluminal fluid or gas. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber throughout. Portal vein, splenic vein, and SMV are well opacified.    - **CT pelvis:** Partially distended bladder and uterus are within normal limits. There are no adnexal masses. There is no pelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.    - **Bone windows:** No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is identified."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast shows a fluid-filled appendix with mild wall thickening and adjacent fat stranding, which is consistent with appendicitis. The absence of extraluminal fluid or gas and the lack of significant lymphadenopathy suggest that the appendicitis is likely early or mild. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and headache are also consistent with appendicitis. Given the imaging findings and the patient's clinical presentation, I am confident in making a diagnosis of appendicitis.
