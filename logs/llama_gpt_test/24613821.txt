HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/h/o psoriatic arthritis on enbrel and methotrexate p/w  abdominal pain for the last ___ days.  She notes that 2 days ago  it got acutely worse and localized to the RLQ.  No N/V.  No  F/c/ns.  No dysuria/hematuria.  No hematochezia/melena    Past Medical History: PMH: psoriatic arthritis, high blood pressure. PSH: Hysterectomy, back surgery, debridement LLE wound ___: Atenolol 25', Enbrel 50qwk, methotrexate 20qwk, gabapentin  100''', hctz 12.5', ativan 0.5prn, Simvastatin 5', ibuprofen  800''', ALL: NKDA    Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain that has localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) over the past few days, which is a classic symptom for appendicitis. However, the patient's history of psoriatic arthritis and use of medications such as Enbrel (etanercept) and methotrexate may also increase the risk of other conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulitis. Given the acute worsening of symptoms, it's essential to rule out any life-threatening conditions.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a relatively normal complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), and liver function tests (LFTs). The urinalysis results are also largely unremarkable, with only a trace amount of blood and a few red blood cells present. However, the absence of ESR and CRP results limits our ability to fully assess the patient's inflammatory status. Given the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain localized to the RLQ, further imaging studies are necessary to rule out conditions such as appendicitis or other causes of acute abdominal pain.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan, Appendicitis protocol,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Multi detector CT images through the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were generated and reviewed. No oral contrast was administered. DLP 608 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **Chest:** Bibasilar atelectatic changes are identified. There is no pericardial effusion.  **Abdomen:** The liver enhances homogeneously. No focal lesion is identified. There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The portal vein is patent. There is a 1.5 cm radioopaque stone within the gallbladder, seen previously on examination dated ___ without evidence of cholecystitis. Pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable. Kidneys enhance symmetrically with bilateral cortical hypodensities, too small to characterize though statistically most probably simple cysts. Stomach, loops of small bowel, and colon are unremarkable. Mild diverticular disease is seen without diverticulitis. No evidence of obstruction. A retrocecal appendix is dilated measuring 1 cm thick, fluid filled, with mucosal enhancement and surrounding fat stranding most compatible with acute appendicitis (601b:30 and 2:56). The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber without aneurysmal dilatation. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  **Pelvis:** The bladder is unremarkable. The uterus is not visualized. The left ovary is unremarkable. The right ovary is not definitely visualized. There is trace pelvic free fluid, likely physiologic.  **Osseous structures:** No suspicious lytic or blastic lesion is identified. There is redemonstration of L3 hemangioma. Mild degenerative changes noted with anterolisthesis of L4 on L5, stable from prior examination."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast has revealed a dilated retrocecal appendix with surrounding fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis. The presence of a radioopaque stone in the gallbladder is noted, but there is no evidence of cholecystitis. The rest of the abdominal and pelvic structures appear unremarkable. Given the imaging findings, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain localized to the RLQ are most likely due to acute appendicitis.
