Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with PMHx notable for HTN, HLD, Belly's palsy, recent ___ admission to ___ for RUQ pain diagnosed with choledocholithiasis s/p ERCP/sphincterotomy c/b post-ERCP pancreatitis who presents to  ED ___ with abdominal pain.  Patient reports that she was seen in the surgical clinic last week to schedule definitive management with cholecystectomy. She is scheduled to have her gallbladder removed at ___ on ___. However at 4 AM this morning  her pain severely worsened. She feels very nauseous. She returned to the ED for reevaluation. She denies any fevers or chills. She  has not had any episodes of emesis. No urinary symptoms, diarrhea, constipation.  On arrival to the floor, patient reports feeling improved pain and nausea after receiving pain medicine/Zofran.  She states she has had constant dull RUQ pain, described as starting in her right flank and radiating to her RUQ, which is worsened by  eating and will last for hours after meals.  She has had associated nausea but no vomiting.  Pain at its peak is ___.  After discharge from ___, she stated her right sided pain quickly returned but she didn't want to re-present to a hospital unless the pain got more severe.  Her goal was to make it to her outpatient CCY surgery on ___ to have the gall  bladder taken out.  She really doesn't want to have an ERCP again  because she stated she had ERCP related pancreatitis during previously admission.  She will undergo ERCP though if needed.  Interestingly, she has noted left lower rib pain, tender to touch, constant.  She first noted this after her ERCP. For her pain, she takes Aleve often.  She was taking 2 tablets of  unknown strength Aleve q6-8H for several days prior to her ___ admission, however, in the last week, she has only been taking Aleve daily, with food.  The Aleve helps somewhat.  She does  note a recent increase in acid reflux/GERD and reports her PPI is not helping. She takes her PPI when she is symptomatic however and with a full stomach.  She eats a lot of spicy food.  No smoking or EtOH use or history of PUD.  Denies melena, hematochezia, fevers, chills, dysuria, hematuria, urinary frequency, lower  back pain, cough, chest pain.        Past Medical History: - Bell's palsy since age ___ with associated chronic left face/neck pain (constant, sharp infraorbital, supraorbital, posterior auricular) - s/p Left Supraorbital nerve block, Left Infraorbital nerve block Left Greater Occipital Nerve Block, Left Auriculotemporal Nerve Block ___ - ___ admission to ___ w/ RUQ pain, diagnosed with choledocholithiasis on CT imaging s/p ERCP without stone retrieval from CDB given spontaneous stone passage c/b post-ERCP pancreatitis, no cholangitis - Diagnostic lap r/o endometriosis ___ - Laparoscopic appendectomy - HLD - HTN    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother, sisters x 2 and father have history of GB disease.

Thought: The patient has a history of choledocholithiasis, post-ERCP pancreatitis, and is scheduled for a cholecystectomy. She presents with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, and constant dull RUQ pain that radiates to her right flank and is worsened by eating. She also has left lower rib pain, tender to touch, and a recent increase in acid reflux/GERD. To further evaluate her condition, I need to consider the possibility of complications related to her previous ERCP, such as a bile duct injury or recurrent choledocholithiasis, as well as other potential causes of her abdominal pain, such as peptic ulcer disease or pancreatitis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated ALT and AST, which could indicate some degree of liver injury or inflammation. The alkaline phosphatase is also slightly elevated, which could be related to her previous choledocholithiasis or other liver or bone conditions. The lipase level is within normal limits, which makes acute pancreatitis less likely. The patient's electrolyte panel and renal function tests are within normal limits. To further evaluate her condition, I would like to consider imaging studies to assess her gallbladder and biliary system.

The contour of the liver is smooth. There is no focal liver mass. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is no ascites.  **BILE DUCTS:** There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. The CHD measures 7 mm which is similar compared to prior CT.  **GALLBLADDER:** There is no evidence of stones or gallbladder wall thickening.  **PANCREAS:** The imaged portion of the pancreas appears within normal limits, without masses or pancreatic ductal dilation, with portions of the pancreatic tail obscured by overlying bowel gas.  **SPLEEN:** Normal echogenicity, measuring 9.8 cm.  **KIDNEYS:** Limited views of the right kidney show no hydronephrosis.  **RETROPERITONEUM:** The visualized portions of aorta and IVC are within normal limits."

Thought: The abdominal ultrasound shows a normal gallbladder without stones or wall thickening, and the common hepatic duct (CHD) measures 7 mm, which is similar to the previous CT scan. The liver appears diffusely echogenic, but there is no focal liver mass or ascites. The imaged portion of the pancreas appears normal, and the spleen and kidneys are also within normal limits. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I would like to consider a CT scan of the abdomen with contrast to better visualize the pancreas and surrounding structures.
