HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with known cholelithiasis and a history of intermittent  epigastric pain presents with 6-hours of RUQ/epigastric pain  accompanied by nausea/vomiting. Pt has been evaluated by her PCP  several times over the past few months for intermittent  epigastric pain that was initially felt to be related to  esophageal spasm. She recently underwent RUQ ultrasound, which  she reports to have shown cholelithiasis. She is currently  scheduled for outpatient surgical evaluation for  cholecystectomy. Last evening, however, her pain returned. She  describes a severe pain in her RUQ/epigastrium with radiation  through to her right back, similar to other episodes she has  had. However, this time she had nausea and multiple bouts of  nonbloody, nonbilious emesis and chills. She has noted loose,  light colored stools over the recent days as well.  She  otherwise denies fevers, recent travel, or sick contacts. As she  reflects on the recent months, even between exacerbations she  cannot recall a time where she was completely pain free with no  discomfort.      Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Seasonal allergies, Allergy-induced asthma, Rosacea, Hx  obstructing renal calculi s/p lithotripsy/stent placement,  Cholelithiasis  Past Surgical History: Hysteroscopy w/ polypectomy, Lap R ovarian endometrioma  excision, Rhinoplasty, Lithotripsy/ureteral dilation and ureteral stent  placement (___)    Social History: ___ Family History: Non contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a history of cholelithiasis and intermittent epigastric pain, which has recently escalated to severe RUQ/epigastric pain accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and chills. The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible complication related to her cholelithiasis, such as cholecystitis or a gallstone causing a bile duct obstruction. Given the patient's scheduled outpatient surgical evaluation for cholecystectomy, it is essential to assess her current condition to determine if immediate intervention is required.

If you need further information or additional tests, please let me know!"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The liver function tests are relatively normal, but the lipase level is elevated, suggesting possible pancreatitis. However, the clinical presentation and other laboratory results must be considered to determine the likelihood of pancreatitis versus another condition, such as cholecystitis or a gallstone causing a bile duct obstruction.

"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Ultrasound, CT Abdomen with Contrast,\" is not available in the provided list. The available imaging study is \"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound): LIVER AND GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND,\" which does not match the requested imaging."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results suggest a possible gallbladder pathology, such as cholecystitis or a gallstone causing a bile duct obstruction. An abdominal ultrasound or CT scan with contrast would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. However, since the requested imaging study is not available, I will proceed with the available information.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation in the epigastrium and RUQ, which is consistent with cholecystitis or a gallstone causing a bile duct obstruction. The negative Murphy's sign does not rule out cholecystitis, as it can be negative in up to 20% of cases. Given the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory results, and physical examination findings, I am ready to provide a final diagnosis and treatment plan.
