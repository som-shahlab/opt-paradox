Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ otherwise healthy presents with ___ h/o right lower quadrant  pain accompanied by nausea and one episode of emesis last night.  She had one bowel movement, loose. No fevers or chills. No prior  similar episodes in the past.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Colelithiasis  Past Surgical History: Lap CCY ___ years ago    Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and emesis, which could be indicative of several conditions, including appendicitis, cholecystitis, or a gastrointestinal infection. The patient's history of cholelithiasis and previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LCY) is also relevant, as it may increase the risk of certain complications. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I would like to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The liver function tests are mostly within normal limits, although the AST is slightly elevated. The lipase level is within normal limits, which makes pancreatitis less likely. The urinalysis shows some abnormalities, including proteinuria and ketonuria, but no significant hematuria or leukocyturia. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, I would like to order some imaging studies to further evaluate the patient's condition.

"The requested imaging study is an Abdominal CT scan, which matches the available imaging study: CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT). Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Acquisition sequence:  1) Stationary Acquisition 4.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 19.3 mGy (Body) DLP = 9.6 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 4.7 s, 51.5 cm; CTDIvol = 8.7 mGy (Body) DLP = 449.3 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 459 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: LOWER CHEST: The visualized lung bases are clear. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver is homogeneous in background attenuation, without focal lesion or intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilation. The main portal vein is patent. The gallbladder is surgically absent.  PANCREAS: The pancreas is normal in attenuation without mass, ductal dilation, or peripancreatic stranding or fluid collection.  SPLEEN: The spleen is homogeneous and borderline in size, measuring 12.8 cm.  ADRENALS: The adrenal glands are normal in caliber and configuration bilaterally.  URINARY: The kidneys are symmetric and normal in size, demonstrating normal nephrograms and excreting contrast promptly. There is no concerning focal renal lesion or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is decompressed. Small bowel loops are normal in caliber without wall thickening or evidence of obstruction. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. A retrocecal fluid-filled appendix is visualized. There is no significant surrounding fat stranding, but the wall is mildly hyperemic and thickened with the overall diameter of the appendix is top-normal/borderline in size, measuring 6-7 mm. This may reflect very early or mild ____.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus is within normal limits. A 2.8 cm adnexal cyst, likely ovarian, is noted on the left.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."
