HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
HPI: ___ F presents with 36 hrs of RLQ pain. Pt reports pain initially periumbilical then localized to RLQ yesterday. Associated anorexia, nausea and vomiting x 1. One episode of watery diarrhea yesterday. Denies fevers, chills, previous episodes abd pain. Currently pain has resolved and only feels mild discomfort.    Past Medical History:  anxiety    Social History: ___ Family History: nc


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a classic history of right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain that initially started as periumbilical pain, which is suggestive of appendicitis. The pain has since resolved, and the patient only feels mild discomfort. However, the initial presentation of pain migrating from the periumbilical area to the RLQ, along with associated symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, warrants further investigation to rule out appendicitis or other causes of abdominal pain.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal Tenderness, Rebound Tenderness, McBurney's Point Tenderness, Rovsing's Sign

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination reveals minimal tenderness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) with no rebound or guarding, which could suggest that the patient's condition may be improving or that the initial concern for appendicitis might not be as severe as initially thought. However, the presence of any abdominal tenderness, especially in the RLQ, warrants further investigation to determine the cause of the pain.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: Complete Blood Count, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine, Electrolyte Panel, Urinalysis, Lipase, Amylase

ToolMessage:

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The rest of the CBC is relatively normal. The BUN and creatinine levels are within normal limits, suggesting no significant kidney dysfunction. The electrolyte panel is also mostly normal, with a slight elevation in glucose in the urinalysis, which could be related to the patient's recent episode of vomiting or other factors. The urinalysis does show some abnormalities, including a cloudy appearance, trace protein, and the presence of leukocytes, which could suggest a urinary tract infection or other urinary issue, but the absence of nitrites and the low number of WBCs in the urine make this less likely. The absence of lipase and amylase results limits the ability to assess for pancreatitis.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal CT scan with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Contiguous axial MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of IV and oral contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats were obtained and reviewed.  **FINDINGS:**  **CHEST:** The bases of the lungs are clear without nodules or consolidation. There is no pleural effusion. The base of the heart is unremarkable.  **ABDOMEN:** The liver is normal in shape and contour. There are no focal hepatic masses. The portal vein is patent. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. There is no hydronephrosis or renal mass. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast appropriately. The stomach is collapsed. The small bowel is unremarkable. There is no mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The abdominal vasculature is normal in course and caliber.  **PELVIS:** The appendix is enlarged measuring 12 mm and does not fill with oral contrast. There is mild associated stranding, although there is a paucity of fat within the abdomen. There is no surrounding free air, free fluid, or evidence of abscess. These findings are consistent with acute uncomplicated appendicitis. The large bowel is unremarkable without focal dilation or masses. The bladder, uterus, and adnexa are normal. There is trace free fluid in the pelvis, likely physiologic. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.  **OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:** There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic bony lesions. Acute uncomplicated appendicitis without evidence of perforation or abscess."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan with contrast shows an enlarged appendix with mild associated stranding, consistent with acute uncomplicated appendicitis. The absence of free air, free fluid, or evidence of abscess suggests that the appendicitis is not complicated. The rest of the abdominal and pelvic structures appear normal.
