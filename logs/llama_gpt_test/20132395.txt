HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ is a ___ male with opioid use disorder on Suboxone, HCV, and recent h/o bilateral iliac artery  occlusion s/p aorto-bifem bypass (___) who presented to ___ with constant, worsening abdominal pain and was transferred to ___ after he was found to have a possible pancreatic pseudocysts on CT imaging.  After the bypass in ___, he started to have intermittent  sharp epigastric pain that was mild but would last for a day or two.  It did not seem to be associated with eating/drinking. Nothing seemed to make the pain worse. He thought it was pain from his bowels because it was similar to pain he experienced when he had an ileus in the past. Over the past few months, the pain has  been growing more severe. About 3 days ago, he developed a very  severe episode of epigastric abdominal pain that has been radiating to the LUQ and has been constant since onset. Yesterday he was nauseated and vomited ___ times (the first episode was dark brown; subsequent episodes were clear/yellow; no blood). He was not able to keep anything down yesterday - even sips of water. The last time he ate anything was ___ night when he had a BLT, pickles, and some chips.  He has been having formed, brown bowel movements daily however has not had a bowel movement in about 4 days. He does not feel constipated.  No fevers/chills. No lightheadedness or dizziness. No chest  pain. He feels like he can't take a deep breath due to abdominal pain but he does not feel short of breath. No coughing. He has mild nausea currently. No dysuria.   ED COURSE: VS: Tmax 98.3, HR ___, BP 150s-160s/80s-90s, RR ___, SpO2 97-99% on RA Exam: "left upper quadrant/epigastric tenderness without rebound or guarding" Labs: WBC 17, ALP 135, lipase 74, lactate 1.5 Imaging: CT abd/pelvis from OSH, RUQ US showing loculated fluid collection at the pancreatic tail Consultants: GI/Pancreas - NPO, IV fluids, IV pain meds,  continue ___ review imaging with radiology to consider ___ drainage Interventions: hydromorphone 1 mg IV x2, ondansetron 4 mg IV x1, Zosyn 4.5 g x1, vancomycin 1000mg IV x1    Past Medical History:  - Opioid use disorder on Suboxone  - Chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy s/p spinal cord stimulator  - Chronic HCV s/p Harvoni  - Tobacco use disorder  - H/o bilateral iliac artery occlusion s/p aorto-bifem bypass (___)    Social History: ___ Family History: FAMILY HISTORY:  No family history of aortic disease or sudden death


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with constant, worsening abdominal pain, and a possible pancreatic pseudocyst on CT imaging. The patient's history of opioid use disorder, HCV, and recent aorto-bifem bypass surgery are relevant. The patient's symptoms of severe epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the left upper quadrant, nausea, vomiting, and lack of bowel movements for 4 days suggest a possible pancreatic or gastrointestinal issue. The lab results show an elevated WBC count, elevated ALP, and elevated lipase, which may indicate pancreatitis or a pancreatic pseudocyst.
