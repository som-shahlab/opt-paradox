HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male with no significant medical  history who presents with generalized abdominal pain. He reports  that the pain started yesterday and has been near the lower  midline portion of the abdomen. It is associated with anorexia,  bloating and subjective fevers, diaphoresis but no n/v or  changes in BMs. He has never had similar pain. He reported  eating seafood a couple of days ago but his wife did not develop  similar symptoms. ROS is positive for headaches, URI symptoms,  and fatigue starting late last week, for which he has been  taking ibuprofen. He has no personal or family history of IBD  and has never had a colonoscopy. His grandfather had colon  cancer in his ___. He last ate at breakfast time ___ a bagel).    Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: Colon cancer in grandfather in ___. Otherwise noncontributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with generalized abdominal pain, anorexia, bloating, and subjective fevers, which could be indicative of a gastrointestinal issue, such as appendicitis, gastroenteritis, or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The patient's recent history of eating seafood could be a potential cause of food poisoning, but the fact that his wife did not develop similar symptoms makes this less likely. The patient's use of ibuprofen for headaches, URI symptoms, and fatigue could be contributing to his abdominal pain. Given the patient's symptoms and lack of significant medical history, further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of his abdominal pain.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal Tenderness, McBurney's Point Tenderness, Guarding, Rebound Tenderness

ToolMessage:
"Vitals: T 97.8, HR 80, BP 117/64, RR 18, SpO2 98% RA  GEN: A&Ox3, lying comfortably in bed HEENT: No scleral icterus CV: RRR PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, non-distended, appropriately mildly tender to  palpation.  Surgical incisions clean, dry, well approximated EXT: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination results show mild abdominal tenderness, but no significant guarding or rebound tenderness, which could indicate a less severe abdominal condition. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and the rest of the physical examination is unremarkable. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination results, laboratory tests are needed to further evaluate the cause of his abdominal pain.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory test results show a normal white blood cell count, which suggests that there may not be a significant infectious or inflammatory process. The basic metabolic panel results are also within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated glucose level. The liver function tests are normal, which suggests that there is no significant liver dysfunction. The lipase level is normal, which makes pancreatitis less likely. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory test results, imaging studies are needed to further evaluate the cause of his abdominal pain.

"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration. Oral contrast was not administered.

This is consistent with the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, anorexia, and bloating. Given the diagnosis of appendicitis, surgical intervention is likely necessary to prevent complications such as perforation or abscess formation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
