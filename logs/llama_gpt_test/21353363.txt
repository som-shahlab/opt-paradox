HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ presenting with 3 days of RLQ abdominal pain. Patient was having severe nausea/vomiting x 9 times initially. She was seen at ___ 3 days ago. Patient was tender in the RLQ, WBC was 15.___bd/pelvis was reported as normal appendix, some free fluid in the pelvis and an adnexal cyst. She was discharged home and followed up with her GYN. Patient had persistent abdominal pain localized in the RLQ, no nausea or vomiting, no fevers/chills. Pt went to OBGYN which did a pelvic exam which was normal and negative pregnancy test. Pelvic US was also negative.    Past Medical History:  PE ___ s/p anticoagulation for 6 months    Family History: Noncontributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a 3-day history of right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain, initially accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting. The initial evaluation included a normal appendix on imaging, but with some free fluid in the pelvis and an adnexal cyst. Given the persistence of abdominal pain localized to the RLQ without nausea, vomiting, fevers, or chills, and a negative pelvic exam, negative pregnancy test, and negative pelvic ultrasound, the differential diagnosis may include conditions such as a ruptured ovarian cyst, appendicitis (despite the initial normal appendix imaging, as appendicitis can be recurrent or the initial imaging might have been early in the disease process), or other causes of abdominal pain like intestinal obstruction, inflammatory bowel disease, or a hernia. The patient's past medical history of pulmonary embolism and anticoagulation therapy could also potentially influence the clinical picture, especially if there were concerns about bleeding or thrombosis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count (14.7 K/uL), which could indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The rest of the CBC is relatively within normal limits. The basic metabolic panel (BMP) and liver function tests (LFTs) are also within normal limits, which suggests that there is no significant electrolyte imbalance, renal dysfunction, or liver injury at this time. The lipase level is within normal limits, making acute pancreatitis less likely. However, the absence of ESR and CRP results limits the ability to fully assess the inflammatory status. Given the persistence of RLQ abdominal pain and the initial finding of an adnexal cyst, further evaluation of the abdominal and pelvic region is warranted.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal and Pelvic CT scan with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal and Pelvic CT scan with contrast,\" is available. Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast. Multiplanar reformations were obtained and reviewed.  **FINDINGS:**  - The partially imaged lungs show bibasilar atelectasis. - The partially imaged heart is unremarkable.  **CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:** - The liver, spleen, both adrenals, both kidneys, pancreas, and gallbladder are unremarkable. - No abdominal, retroperitoneal, or mesenteric lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria is present. - The colon is unremarkable. - The appendix shows a thickened wall with significant adjacent stranding, ending in a 1.1 x 2.0 cm fluid-filled tip. This is worsened compared to the previous examination. - There is a small amount of nonhemorrhagic free fluid in the pelvis. - Multiple dilated loops of small bowel show no transition point and are likely related to ileus. - Contrast fills the colon.  **CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:** - The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and uterus are unremarkable. - Bilateral ovarian cysts were better evaluated on concurrent pelvic ultrasound. - No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is present.  **OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:** - The visible osseous structures show no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions or fractures."

AIMessage:
Thought: The abdominal and pelvic CT scan with contrast shows a thickened appendix with significant adjacent stranding and a fluid-filled tip, which is worsened compared to the previous examination. This finding, combined with the patient's persistent right lower quadrant abdominal pain, strongly suggests acute appendicitis. The presence of a small amount of nonhemorrhagic free fluid in the pelvis and multiple dilated loops of small bowel without a transition point, likely related to ileus, further supports this diagnosis. The bilateral ovarian cysts noted on the CT scan, which were also seen on the previous pelvic ultrasound, could be an incidental finding but should be considered in the context of the patient's overall clinical presentation.

Action: physical examination
Action Input: Tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign

ToolMessage:
"Upon presentation to ___: Vitals: 98.0 74 115/79 16 100%  GEN: A&Ox3, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, severe tenderness to palpation in the RLQ, mild localized rebound and guarding. Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination reveals severe tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, mild localized rebound, and guarding, which are classic signs of peritonitis and strongly support the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The absence of other significant findings on physical examination, such as scleral icterus, murmurs, or peripheral edema, helps to rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain.

Given the combination of the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory results, imaging findings, and physical examination, the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is highly likely.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Ruptured ovarian cyst
3. Intestinal obstruction
4. Inflammatory bowel disease
5. Incidental bilateral ovarian cysts

Treatment: The patient should undergo urgent surgical consultation for potential appendectomy. Preoperative management should include bowel preparation, administration of broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential bacterial peritonitis, and fluid resuscitation as needed. Postoperative care should focus on pain management, monitoring for signs of infection or complications, and gradual return to normal activities. Follow-up with the surgical team and primary care physician is essential to ensure complete recovery and to address any potential long-term sequelae.
