HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with history of chronic vague abdominal pain, with diagnoses of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (no longer using) and IBS, presenting with acutely worsened abdominal pain in the past day. She normally has epigastric/upper abdominal pain predominantly, but reports this is more generalized. She has had severe nausea with several episodes of emesis (last last night) and has been unable to tolerate PO. She also reports shaking chills, no  fever, chest pain, or dyspnea.   Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome IBS "Psych history"  Past Surgical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory. No fam hx of colon or GI cancer.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acutely worsened abdominal pain, severe nausea, and emesis, which could be indicative of a gastrointestinal issue. Given her history of cannabis hyperemesis syndrome and IBS, it's possible that her symptoms are related to these conditions. However, the sudden worsening of symptoms and the presence of shaking chills suggest that another underlying condition may be contributing to her presentation. 

To further evaluate the patient's condition, laboratory tests and imaging studies would be helpful in identifying potential causes of her symptoms, such as infections, inflammatory conditions, or other gastrointestinal disorders.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a potential infection or inflammatory process. The presence of ketones in the urine suggests that the patient may be experiencing some degree of dehydration or metabolic disturbance. The liver function tests are relatively normal, which makes liver disease or dysfunction less likely. The lipase level is within normal limits, which decreases the likelihood of acute pancreatitis. 

Given the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis, along with the laboratory results, it would be helpful to obtain imaging studies to further evaluate the patient's condition.

"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:**  **EXAMINATION:** CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  **TECHNIQUE:** 212 Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Acquisition sequence:  1) Stationary Acquisition 0.5 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 2.4 mGy (Body) DLP = 1.2 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 7.1 s, 55.6 cm; CTDIvol = 23.7 mGy (Body) DLP = 1,316.9 mGy-cm.

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan with contrast shows a fluid-filled and dilated appendix with wall thickening and associated stranding of the surrounding mesentery, compatible with acute appendicitis. The presence of an appendicolith within the appendix further supports this diagnosis. Given the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis, along with the imaging findings, it is likely that the patient has acute appendicitis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination is consistent with acute appendicitis, with focal moderate tenderness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and voluntary guarding. The presence of a high white blood cell count, along with the imaging findings of a fluid-filled and dilated appendix with wall thickening, further supports this diagnosis. Given the patient's symptoms and diagnostic findings, it is likely that the patient requires surgical intervention to treat the acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Intestinal obstruction
4. Inflammatory bowel disease
5. Diverticulitis

Treatment: The patient should be taken to the operating room for an appendectomy, which is the surgical removal of the appendix. The patient should also receive broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential bacterial infections. Additionally, the patient should be monitored for any signs of complications, such as abscess formation or peritonitis. Pain management and hydration should also be prioritized. Post-operatively, the patient should be followed up with to ensure proper wound healing and to address any potential concerns or complications.
