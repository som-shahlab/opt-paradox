HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male patient with past medical  history positive for paroxysmal A fib, restless leg syndrome and  diverticulosis with episodes of diverticulitis treated with  antibiotics who reports started presenting abdominal pain 24  hours ago.  He reports yesterday after dinner a severe right  upper quadrant pain which he reports has happened before but not  this severe, when he has had these episodes of pain before he  reports that they subsided without any pain medication.  He has  never been told that he has stones in his gallbladder.  He  denies any nausea or emesis.  He denies any fever or chills.  He  denies any changes in bowel movements.  Patient reports that he  has had multiple episodes of acute diverticulitis treated with  antibiotics, so he thought this was 1 of these episodes.  Due to  symptoms worsening and patient having decreased appetite he  presented to our ED for further management.   Past Medical History: - recent diagnosis of pericarditis thought to be secondary to  viral pericarditis with course c/b Aflutter  requiring CV. - recent PNA treated with levofloxacin - Hyperlipidemia   - GERD   - Hypertension   - Possible GI bleed in past (patient reports he was admitted and  monitored, had an upper endosocpy, had gastritis).  Also with  hemorrhoids.   - Restless leg syndrome   - Tonsillectomy    Social History: ___ Family History: Patient's father passed away from melanoma "at an old age," and  his mother of a renal cancer in her ___. No history of heart  disease.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with severe right upper quadrant pain, which has occurred before but not to this severity. The patient's past medical history includes diverticulitis, which he initially thought might be the cause of his current symptoms. However, the severity of the pain and the decrease in appetite prompted him to seek further management. Given the location of the pain, possible causes could include gallbladder disease (e.g., cholecystitis or cholelithiasis), peptic ulcer disease, or even a recurrence of diverticulitis. The patient's history of pericarditis, recent pneumonia, and possible GI bleed also needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The liver function tests are mostly within normal limits, although the alkaline phosphatase is slightly elevated, which could be seen in various conditions, including bone disorders or liver disease. The lipase level is within normal limits, making acute pancreatitis less likely. Given the patient's symptoms of severe right upper quadrant pain and the laboratory results, further evaluation with imaging studies would be helpful to assess for gallbladder disease, liver disease, or other possible causes of the patient's pain.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Right Upper Quadrant Ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Right Upper Quadrant Ultrasound,\" is not available in the list of available imaging studies. However, there is a \"Liver or Gallbladder US (Single Organ)\" ultrasound report available, which may partially match the request. Here is the full report for that study:  **LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound):**  **EXAMINATION:** LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  **TECHNIQUE:** Grey scale and color Doppler ultrasound images of the abdomen were obtained.  **FINDINGS:**  - **LIVER:** The hepatic parenchyma appears within normal limits. The contour of the liver is smooth. There is no focal liver mass. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is no ascites. - **BILE DUCTS:** There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. Mild pneumobilia is noted, likely on a background of recent ERCP. The common bile duct is only partially visualized and measures up to 8 mm in diameter. The biliary stent is not confidently identified. - **GALLBLADDER:** The gallbladder is distended. There is mild pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening, up to 9 mm. No overt gallbladder wall hyperemia. There remains a non-mobile 13 mm calculus at the gallbladder neck, as seen on the CT performed ___. - **PANCREAS:** The imaged portion of the pancreas appears within normal limits, without masses or pancreatic ductal dilation, with portions of the pancreatic tail obscured by overlying bowel gas. - **SPLEEN:** Normal echogenicity. Spleen length: 9.6 cm - **KIDNEYS:** Limited views of the kidneys show no hydronephrosis. There is a simple cyst at the interpolar region of the left kidney measuring approximately 4 cm in maximal dimension. The 6 mm calculus at the lower pole of the left kidney seen on the CT performed ___ is not definitely identified on today's ultrasound. Right kidney: 11.8 cm, Left kidney: 10.9 cm - **RETROPERITONEUM:** The visualized portions of aorta and IVC are within normal limits."

AIMessage:
Thought: The ultrasound report shows a distended gallbladder with mild pericholecystic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening, which are indicative of acute cholecystitis. The presence of a non-mobile 13 mm calculus at the gallbladder neck further supports this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of severe right upper quadrant pain and the ultrasound findings are consistent with acute cholecystitis. Given the patient's history of diverticulitis and the presence of a biliary stent, it is possible that the patient has a history of biliary disease.

Action: physical examination
Action Input: Murphy's Sign, Abdominal Tenderness

ToolMessage:
"ADMISSION  Vital Signs  Temp 97.7 HR 104 BP 142/87 RR 18 O2Sat: 95% RA  Physical Exam  General: resting comfortably in NAD HEENT: EOMI, PERRL, anicteric Neck: supple, no LAD Chest: CTAB, no respiratory distress Heart: RRR, normal S1&S2 Abdomen: protuberant abdomen, moderately distended, tender to palpation in RUQ, (+) ___ sign, no rebound or guarding  Neuro: alert and oriented x3 Extremities: no edema"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination is consistent with acute cholecystitis, as evidenced by the presence of abdominal tenderness in the right upper quadrant and a positive Murphy's sign. The patient's vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure, which could be indicative of pain or inflammation. Given the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute cholecystitis.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute cholecystitis
2. Biliary colic
3. Choledocholithiasis
4. Peptic ulcer disease
5. Diverticulitis
Treatment: The patient should be admitted to the hospital for further management. The treatment plan should include:
- Intravenous fluids for hydration
- Pain management with analgesics
- Antibiotics to cover for possible infection
- Bowel rest to reduce gallbladder stimulation
- Surgical consultation for possible cholecystectomy
- Monitoring of liver function tests and complete blood count to assess for any complications or worsening of the condition.
