Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ p/w unprovoked RUQ/midepigastric pain that began ~12hrs  prior to presentation. It had no relation to good. She had4-5 episodes of emesis (NBNB). She also had chills but without fevers. She initially went to ___ where LFTs ALT 18, AST 20, Tbili 0.1 and AP 106. Troponin was negative RUQ US showed distended GB w. stones and ___ 8mm. She was then transferred to the ___ for further care.   Of note, she has never had classical symptoms of biliary colic. About 1 week ago, she came back from a recent travel and had 1 episode of emesis that resolved. SHe did not have abdominal pan at the time.     Past Medical History: Past Medical History: HTN Hypothyrpodism Mood disorder Anxiety/Depression  Past Surgical History: C-sectionx2 ___ LEEP procedure Lithotripsy    Social History: ___ Family History: Family History:none


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with unprovoked right upper quadrant (RUQ) and midepigastric pain, episodes of emesis, and chills without fevers. The laboratory tests show normal liver function tests (LFTs) with slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase (AP). The RUQ ultrasound revealed a distended gallbladder with stones and a possible common bile duct (CBD) stone. Given the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the patient likely has a biliary pathology, such as cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's total bilirubin is within normal limits, and the lipase level is slightly elevated, which may indicate a mild pancreatic injury or inflammation. The CBC results show a normal white blood cell count, which reduces the likelihood of an acute infectious process. The hematocrit and hemoglobin levels are slightly low, which may indicate mild anemia. Given the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the patient likely has a biliary pathology, such as cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan, Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), is available. Here is the full report:  **Study Name: MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC) (MRCP)**  **EXAMINATION: MRCP**  **TECHNIQUE:** T1- and T2-weighted multiplanar images of the abdomen were acquired in a 1.5 T magnet. Intravenous contrast: 7 mL Gadavist. Oral contrast: 1 cc of Gadavist mixed with 50 cc of water was administered for oral contrast.  **FINDINGS:**  - **Lower Thorax:** There is no pleural effusion.    - **Liver:** Liver demonstrates homogeneous signal intensity throughout. There is no significant drop in signal on opposed phase imaging to suggest hepatic steatosis. No focal hepatic lesions are identified.    - **Biliary:** The gallbladder is distended, and contains several small intraluminal stones. There is wall thickening and pericholecystic fat stranding consistent with ____. There is suggestion of mildly irregular enhancement of the gallbladder wall, particularly near the superior fundus. Intrahepatic bile ducts are not dilated. The extrahepatic bile duct measures up to 6 mm, which is mildly dilated. However, it tapers smoothly at the level of the ampulla and there is no evidence of choledocholithiasis. No evidence of cholangitis.    - **Pancreas:** There is normal intrinsic T1 hyperintense signal throughout the pancreas. No focal parenchymal lesions or ductal dilation. Pancreas divisum is incidentally noted.    - **Spleen:** Spleen is normal in size, without focal lesions.    - **Adrenal Glands:** Normal in size and shape.    - **Kidneys:** The kidneys are unremarkable except for a subcentimeter simple cyst in the left upper pole. No hydronephrosis on either side.    - **Gastrointestinal Tract:** Stomach is unremarkable. There is no bowel obstruction or ascites.    - **Lymph Nodes:** Retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymph nodes are not enlarged by size criteria.    - **Vasculature:** Abdominal aorta is not aneurysmal. Celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and bilateral renal arteries are patent.    - **Osseous and Soft Tissue Structures:** No worrisome osseous lesions are identified. Soft tissues are unremarkable."

AIMessage:
Thought: The MRCP study confirms the presence of a distended gallbladder with small intraluminal stones, wall thickening, and pericholecystic fat stranding, consistent with acute cholecystitis. The extrahepatic bile duct is mildly dilated, but there is no evidence of choledocholithiasis or cholangitis. The pancreas appears normal, although pancreas divisum is incidentally noted. Given the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the patient likely has acute cholecystitis.
