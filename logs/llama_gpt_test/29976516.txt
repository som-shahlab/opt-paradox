HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ male without significant past medical history who  presents for elective ERCP/EUS. The patient was in his usual  state of health until approximately 6 months prior to admission  when he started to have intermittent  episodes of acute  epigastric pain (~ every ___ weeks), lasting minutes, associated  with severe discomfort, incapacitation, and pallor. There was no  clear association with activity or eating, but they seemed to  occur while on the train on his way to work. Over the ___  these episodes began to occur more frequently, and the duration  was occasionally longer (now hours). He was seen by his PCP (Dr. ___ in ___, who obtained blood work, H. pylori,  and an abdominal U/S that showed a dilated common bile duct to  1.5 cm with mild intrahepatic ductal dilation, a thick walled  gallbladder without stones, and artifact suggestive of  adenomyomatosis.   On ___, he was referred to see Dr. ___  surgery ___. ___), who wrote that his "symptoms are likely  from adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder," and that the "ductal  dilation deserves further workup prior to cholecystectomy." An  MRCP was obtained (___) that showed dilated common hepatic  ducts and common bile duct measuring 1.___ile  duct tapers abruptly proximal to the convergence with the  pancreatic duct to 5 mm.  He now presents for ERCP/EUS, showing dilated CBD (10mm)  suspicious for a choledochal cyst as well as a 1cm common  channel at the ampulla consistent with APBJ. A 1 mm polypoid  lesion was seen at the PD orrifice inside the common channel. He  underwent sphincterotomy and bx/brushings of abnormal CBD  mucosa.   After the procedure while in the PACU he developed epigastric  abdominal pain that is non-radiating and associated with nausea  without vomiting. ERCP fellow evaluated the patient and  recommended CT A/P, which is currently pending. On arrival to  the floor the patient reports that the pain has improved significantly from this afternoon, but has not completely  resolved and he continues to feel nauseated without vomiting.  ROS: He denies weight loss, night sweats, fevers, headaches, CP,  SOB, N/V, change in bowels or bladder habits, jaundice.  Pertinent positives and negatives as noted in the HPI; review of  systems otherwise negative.     Past Medical History: Essential hypertension Hyperlipidemia Nephrolithiasis Eosinophilia Prolonged bleeding time (details unclear)    Social History: ___ Family History: Father with stroke Mother with "meningitis"


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a history of intermittent episodes of acute epigastric pain, which have increased in frequency and duration over time. The abdominal ultrasound and MRCP show dilated common bile duct and common hepatic ducts, with a thick-walled gallbladder and adenomyomatosis. The ERCP/EUS reveals a dilated CBD suspicious for a choledochal cyst, a 1cm common channel at the ampulla consistent with APBJ, and a 1mm polypoid lesion at the PD orifice. After the procedure, the patient developed epigastric abdominal pain and nausea, which have improved but not completely resolved. Given the complex biliary anatomy and the patient's symptoms, further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the pain and to rule out any complications from the ERCP/EUS procedure.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a elevated lipase level, which is indicative of pancreatitis. The liver function tests are relatively normal, but the alkaline phosphatase is slightly elevated, which could be related to the biliary dilation. The complete blood count shows a slight elevation in white blood cells, which could be a response to the pancreatitis or another underlying infection. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it is likely that the patient has developed pancreatitis after the ERCP/EUS procedure.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT with contrast,\" matches the following available imaging study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Acquisition sequence:   1) Spiral Acquisition 8.1 s, 52.4 cm; CTDIvol = 8.6 mGy (Body) DLP = 443.5 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 444 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Bilateral luminal atelectasis with the peribronchial thickening in the right lower lobe.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. The common hepatic duct is distended reaching 1.9 cm in diameter with dense material at the level of the distal CBD (series 5, image 20 and series 2 image 33). There is also wall enhancement of the CBD. Mild the prominence of the proximal intrahepatic ducts. The gallbladder contains air gas and is unremarkable. The hepatic vein, portal vein, portal splenic confluence and splenic vein are patent.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas demonstrates no evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. A small focus of air is seen within the main pancreatic duct. There is peripancreatic stranding with fluid around the pancreaticoduodenal area and extending inferiorly in the right paracolic gutter.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. Bilateral cortical cysts are seen with the dominant one at the interpolar region of the right kidney measuring 3.9 cm. Other subcentimeter cortical hypodensity are too small to be characterized. No hydronephrosis.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** Mild thickening of the second part and third part of the duodenum likely related to the adjacent inflammation. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. Trace of free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  **NOTIFICATION:** The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___ ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 10:18 pm, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's abdominal CT with contrast shows a distended common hepatic duct with dense material at the level of the distal CBD, wall enhancement of the CBD, and peripancreatic stranding with fluid around the pancreaticoduodenal area. These findings are consistent with pancreatitis and a possible bile duct obstruction. The presence of air in the main pancreatic duct is also concerning for a potential pancreatic duct injury. Given the patient's symptoms and imaging results, it is likely that the patient has developed post-ERCP pancreatitis with a possible bile duct obstruction.
