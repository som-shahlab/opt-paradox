HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
The patient is a ___ with PMH depression presents with 1d  abdominal pain and nausea.  Pt reports he was in usual state of health and began  feeling abdominal discomfort yesterday afternoon around 3pm in  the periumbilical region.  Later on in evening, pain became more  severe and moved to his RLQ.  Pain is now severe and is  associated with severe nausea.  Denies vomiting.  Denies  diarrhea.  No anorexia.  Has fevers and chills.     Past Medical History: PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY (INCLUDE PRIOR HOSPITALIZATIONS, OUTPATIENT TREATMENTS, MEDICATION/ECT HISTORY, RESPONSE TO TREATMENT, HISTORY OF HOMICIDAL/SUICIDAL/ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR): Pt reports dx of "psychotic disorder" Per OMR, past treatment with ___, MD at ___ On ___ ___ until ___ Patient would not reveal any other information. . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY (INCLUDE HISTORY OF HEAD TRAUMA, SEIZURES, OR OTHER NEUROLOGIC ILLNESS): Pt reports "tooth problems" PCP:  Dr. ___, ___    Social History: ___ Family History: Unknown


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, fever, and chills, which suggests an acute abdominal process. The pain started in the periumbilical region and migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is a classic presentation for appendicitis. However, other diagnoses such as diverticulitis, intestinal obstruction, or mesenteric lymphadenitis should also be considered. The patient's past medical history of depression and psychotic disorder may be relevant, but it is unclear how it relates to the current presentation. 

To further evaluate the patient, I would like to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, which suggests an infectious or inflammatory process. The liver function tests are mildly elevated, but this could be due to a variety of causes. The lipase level is within normal limits, which makes pancreatitis less likely. 

To further evaluate the patient's abdominal pain, I would like to order an imaging study.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study titled \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for the matching study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. IV Contrast: 130 mL Omnipaque. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. Oral contrast was not administered.  **DOSE:** This study involved 4 CT acquisition phases with dose indices as follows: 1) CT Localizer Radiograph 2) CT Localizer Radiograph 3) Stationary Acquisition 7.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 33.7 mGy (Body) DLP = 16.9 mGy-cm. 4) Spiral Acquisition 5.0 s, 54.0 cm; CTDIvol = 10.5 mGy (Body) DLP = 568.7 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 586 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. Multiple small accessory spleens are noted in the left upper quadrant.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. Multiple subcentimeter hypodensities in the right kidney are too small to characterize by CT but statistically likely represent cysts. There is no perinephric abnormality.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is dilated and fluid filled measuring up to 16 mm with wall thickening, hyperemia and surrounding inflammation compatible with ____. There is no evidence of perforation.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The reproductive organs are unremarkable.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."
