Of note, patient recently completed first cycle of po chemo, Palbociclib, which is 3 weeks of chemotherapy and this week she is off. Denies CP, SOB,  melena, hematochezia or urinary symptoms.    Past Medical History: - Breast cancer ___ s/p mastectomy, XRT, chemo (does not know  regimen)   - Allergic reaction ___ mo ago treated with prednisone  (suspected food allergy)   - Arthritis worse in knees   - Daughter stillborn ___ years ago      Social History: ___ Family History: Both parents with HTN. Father died of prostate cancer. Mother  living. No family history of early MI, arrhythmia,  cardiomyopathies, or sudden cardiac death; otherwise  non-contributory.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with a history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, and recurrent metastatic breast cancer, who presents with epigastric and periumbilical abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain started after consuming a cheeseburger and coffee, and has since localized to the right upper quadrant (RUQ). The patient has recently completed a cycle of chemotherapy with Palbociclib. Given the patient's symptoms and history, it is essential to consider potential causes of abdominal pain, such as gastrointestinal issues, liver disease, or chemotherapy-related side effects.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a relatively normal complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests. The lipase level is within normal limits, which makes acute pancreatitis less likely. However, the patient's symptoms of epigastric and periumbilical abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, particularly after consuming a cheeseburger and coffee, suggest a possible gastrointestinal issue. The recent completion of chemotherapy with Palbociclib may also be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

The contour of the liver is smooth. There is no focal liver mass. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is no ascites. - **BILE DUCTS:** There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. - **CHD:** 5 mm - **GALLBLADDER:** Gallbladder contains gallstones and there is gallbladder wall thickening, edema and hypervascularity of the wall. Gallbladder does not appear distended. No pericholecystic fluid. - **PANCREAS:** The imaged portion of the pancreas appears within normal limits, without masses or pancreatic ductal dilation, with portions of the pancreatic tail obscured by overlying bowel gas. - **SPLEEN:** Normal echogenicity.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's abdominal ultrasound shows gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, edema, and hypervascularity of the wall, which suggests acute cholecystitis. The patient's symptoms of epigastric and periumbilical abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, particularly after consuming a cheeseburger and coffee, are consistent with this diagnosis. The recent completion of chemotherapy with Palbociclib may also be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination shows tenderness to palpation in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) with a positive Murphy's sign, which is consistent with acute cholecystitis. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including the abdominal ultrasound, support this diagnosis. Given the patient's history of breast cancer and recent chemotherapy, it is essential to consider the potential risks and benefits of treatment options.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute cholecystitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Chemotherapy-related side effects
4. Peptic ulcer disease
5. Hepatic metastasis
Treatment: The patient should be admitted to the hospital for further management and treatment. The treatment plan should include:
* Intravenous fluids for hydration
* Antibiotics to cover for potential bacterial infection
* Pain management with analgesics
* Bowel rest to reduce gastrointestinal stimulation
* Consideration for surgical consultation for potential cholecystectomy
* Monitoring of liver function tests and complete blood count
* Consideration of antipyretics and antiemetics as needed
* Dietary modifications to avoid fatty or greasy foods that may exacerbate symptoms.
