HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ otherwise healthy male who presents  with abdominal pain that started about 24 hours ago, initially  as vague periumbilical pain but quickly worsened with radiation  to the groin, RLQ, as well as epigastrium. Associated with  subjective fevers, anorexia, multiple episodes of non-bloody emesis, PO intolerance, and belching. Has passed little gas and  endorses diarrhea and dysuria. Patient reports two previous  episodes of self-resolving LLQ abdominal pain. He had been  evaluated in the ED and by GI but work up has been unrevealing.     Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: anxiety  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: none    Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory

Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain that started as vague periumbilical pain and worsened with radiation to the groin, right lower quadrant (RLQ), and epigastrium, accompanied by subjective fevers, anorexia, non-bloody emesis, and other symptoms. The patient's history of similar episodes of self-resolving left lower quadrant (LLQ) abdominal pain and unrevealing workups in the ED and by GI suggests a possible recurrent condition. Given the acute onset and progression of symptoms, it's essential to consider various differential diagnoses, including appendicitis, gastroenteritis, and other abdominal pathologies. To further evaluate the patient, I need to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies.
Action: laboratory tests

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a relatively normal complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), and liver function tests (LFTs). The lipase level is within normal limits, which makes pancreatitis less likely. The urinalysis results show the presence of ketones, which could indicate dehydration or a metabolic state. However, the absence of nitrites, leukocytes, protein, blood, bilirubin, and urobilinogen in the urine makes a urinary tract infection or kidney disease less likely. To further evaluate the patient's abdominal pain, I need to interpret the laboratory results and consider additional imaging studies.

"The requested imaging study is an Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan, which matches the available imaging study: CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST. Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique.

Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is dilated to a maximum of 1.2 cm with periappendiceal fat stranding and mildly thickened and hyperemic walls. No drainable fluid collection is noted.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable.
