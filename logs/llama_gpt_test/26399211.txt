Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old ___ woman with a  history of infectious colitis and diverticulosis who presents  with severe, left-sided abdominal pain. The patient reports that  she began experiencing the abdominal pain 2 months ago, but that  the pain has become acutely worse in the past two days. Two  months ago, she saw her doctor and was given antibiotics for for  infection in her colon which helped the pain to resolve.

Patient reports having chills last night. She reports having ___  nonbloody stools yesterday with her last being bowel movement  being today. Ms. ___ has had a good appetite and last ate  yesterday in the mid-afternoon.  Her last colonoscopy on ___  showed severe diverticulosis, and she was scheduled for a one  year follow-up colonoscopy this ___ (due to poor bowel prep).   Patient reports increased urinary frequency but denies dysuria,  hematuria. She denies chest pain, SOB, lightheadedness.   Past Medical History: Chronic low back pain- degenerative lumbar spondylosis Thyroid nodule Depression    Social History: ___ Family History: No family history of GI problems. Sister has a thyroid condition  but she is not certain of the details.  Sister had lung cancer.   Mother with cardiovascular disease.  Diabetes mellitus in 3  sisters and mother.

Thought: The patient presents with severe, left-sided abdominal pain, which has worsened over the past two days. She has a history of infectious colitis and diverticulosis, and her symptoms have recurred after initial resolution with antibiotics. The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, chills, and increased urinary frequency, suggest a possible infectious or inflammatory process. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I would like to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies.

Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The urinalysis results show a few bacteria and some leukocytes, which could suggest a urinary tract infection. However, the patient denies dysuria or hematuria. The liver function tests are within normal limits. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I would like to interpret the available laboratory results and order some additional tests.

"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT axial images were obtained from the dome of the liver to the pubic symphysis after the administration of IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were provided and reviewed. DLP: 449.47 mGy-cm.  **ABDOMEN:** The visualized bases of the lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The imaged portion of the heart is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesions. The gallbladder is normal and there is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The spleen and pancreas are unremarkable. There is slight fullness to the right adrenal gland, unchanged from prior exam. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast without hydronephrosis. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. No free air or free fluid is seen. The abdominal aorta and its major branches are unremarkable. Incidental note is made of a low lying, retroaortic left renal vein. Multiple diverticula are seen scattered throughout the colon with fat stranding seen near the ascending colon. There is no extraluminal air or fluid collection.  **PELVIS:** The bladder and rectum are normal. At least one fibroid, measuring 4 cm is seen within the uterus. The appendix is not visualized. There is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.  **BONES:** There are no suspicious osseous lesions. Minor degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine are marked by anterior osteophytosis, particularly at L5. Small posterior disc bulges are seen at L3-L4 through L5-S1.  The requested imaging study \"Chest X-ray\" is not available in the provided list."

AIMessage:
Thought: The abdominal CT scan shows multiple diverticula scattered throughout the colon with fat stranding near the ascending colon, which may indicate diverticulitis. The presence of fat stranding suggests an inflammatory process. The CT scan also shows a low-lying, retroaortic left renal vein and a few other incidental findings, but no free air or free fluid is seen. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I would like to interpret the CT scan results and consider a possible diagnosis.

Thought: The patient's physical examination shows tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant (LLQ) and left upper quadrant (LUQ) of the abdomen, which is consistent with the CT scan findings of diverticulitis.
