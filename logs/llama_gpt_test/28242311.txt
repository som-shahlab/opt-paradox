Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Patient is a ___ with h/o gallstones, transferred from ___ ED where she presented with two days of N/V and ___ epigastric pain. She had heartburn during her ___ month of pregnancy but she has never had this epigastric pain before. Prior to this she was in ___ She said that this all started on ___ night, first with the pain which she describes as a "tightening" in her abdomen. Pain worse at night. She had some difficulty breathing because the pain but denies SOB. She had some ? L sided chest pain but this has since resolved. She could not walk given her degree of discomfort. On ___ she began vomiting everything she ate. She notes last emesis was 2am day  of presentation. At ___, abdominal U/S concerning for likely acute cholecystitis. She is ___ weeks post c/s at ___ for first child. Her epigastric pain radiates downwards to her stomach. Pain worse with turning to the side and sitting up.  In ED BG = 66 thus given 1 am D50.  . ultrasound from ___: perisplenic ___ pouch, pericholecystic fluid. Gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening. Not definitely tender although patient reports having been medicated. Findings suggest acute cholecystitis. . ___: notable for lipase >1000, Alk phos 227, ALT 670,  AST 545, Amylase 1753 . In ER: (Triage Vitals:98.8, 113/70, 76, 18, 99% on RA )  Meds Given: Pantoprazole as pt with radiating chest pain  thought to be reflux.  Unasyn 3 g IV once Fluids given: 1L NS  Radiology Studies: none consults called. . PAIN SCALE: ___ - epigastrum  ROS: 12 point ROS reviewed and otherwise negative   Past Medical History: S/p Csection 6 weeks ago for birth of her first child at ___  H/o gallstones    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother with asthma


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with a history of gallstones, presenting with two days of nausea and vomiting, and epigastric pain that worsens at night and radiates downwards to her stomach. The pain is exacerbated by turning to the side and sitting up. She has a history of heartburn during pregnancy but has never experienced this type of epigastric pain before. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including elevated lipase, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, and amylase, suggest acute cholecystitis. The abdominal ultrasound showing pericholecystic fluid, gallstones, and gallbladder wall thickening further supports this diagnosis.

"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Contiguous axial MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of IV contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformatted images were obtained and reviewed. TOTAL DLP: 402.65 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LUNG BASES:** There are trace bilateral pleural effusions and associated dependent atelectasis. The bases of the lungs are otherwise clear. The base of the heart is normal in size. There is no pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:** The liver is normal in shape and contour. There are no focal hepatic lesions. The portal veins are patent. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation. No stone is visualized within the common bile duct. Multiple stones are seen in the gallbladder. The gallbladder is collapsed. The spleen is normal in size. The bilateral adrenal glands and kidneys are normal. There are no renal lesions, hydronephrosis, or pyelonephritis. They enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically. The pancreas is enlarged and edematous. There is significant surrounding fat stranding as well as a large amount of free fluid surrounding the pancreas and tracking into the bilateral paracolic gutters and along the left upper abdomen. This is most consistent with an acute pancreatitis. There is no evidence of a discrete fluid collection to suggest a pseudocyst. The splenic vein is patent. The splenic artery appears normal without evidence of an aneurysm. There are no calcifications in the pancreas to suggest a component of chronic pancreatitis. The stomach and small bowel are normal in course and caliber. There are no specific abnormalities in the left lower quadrant to explain the patient's focal pain, other than the fluid tracking along the paracolic gutter from the pancreatitis. There is no evidence of obstruction. There is no free air. The abdominal vasculature is normal in caliber.  **PELVIS:** The large bowel is normal without evidence of a mass or focal inflammatory changes. The appendix is not definitely visualized, though there are no secondary signs of appendicitis. The bladder is mildly distended, though it is otherwise normal. The uterus is mildly enlarged, consistent with a recent pregnancy and cesarean section. The adnexa are normal. There are no adnexal masses. There is trace free fluid in the pelvis. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:** There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions. No fracture is identified. There are no significant degenerative changes."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination shows evidence of abdominal tenderness, particularly in the mid LLQ, superior supra-pubic, and RLQ areas. The patient's laboratory results and imaging studies are consistent with acute pancreatitis. The presence of gallstones and a history of gallstones suggests that the patient's pancreatitis may be related to a gallstone.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute pancreatitis
2. Cholelithiasis (gallstones)
3. Acute cholecystitis
4. Hyperemesis gravidarum (given the patient's recent pregnancy)
5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (given the patient's history of heartburn)

Treatment: The patient should be treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, pain management, and bowel rest. The patient may require admission to the intensive care unit for close monitoring. The patient's gallstones and cholecystitis may require surgical intervention, such as a cholecystectomy. The patient's pancreatitis may require treatment with antibiotics and nutritional support. The patient's hyperemesis gravidarum and gastroesophageal reflux disease may require treatment with antiemetics and antacids. 

Note: The patient's treatment plan should be individualized based on their specific needs and medical history.
