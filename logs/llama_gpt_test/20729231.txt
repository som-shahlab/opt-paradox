HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year-old female on Coumadin for DVT/PE with  a history of colitis in ___ presenting with abdominal pain  that started yesterday morning at 7AM.  Per her reports the  crampy pain occurred suddenly, localized to the bilateral lower  quadrants associated with nausea but no vomiting.  The pain continued to persists into today with increasing intensity.   Ofnote, she reports that she noticed a "pop" in her left lower  abdominal yesterday afternoon.  Since that time, she has  continued to have flatus and had a last BM today at 10AM.  She  reported that she thought it may have been constipation and took  some Ex-Lax this morning with relief.  She has had mild low  grade fevers last night.  Her last bowel movement was normal  without blood or diarrhea.  Her last colonoscopy with in ___ which showed Grade 1 internal  hemorrhoids, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.   Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Hypercholesterolemia, DVT/PE, ___ esophagus, hiatal hernia, fibromyalgia  Past Surgical History: Left breast lumpectomy s/p chemo  radiation ___ years ago, right leg operation c/b DVT on Coumadin, bilateral toe operations   Social History: ___ Family History: Significant for her mother's side who had breast cancer at the  age of ___ and also a benign brain tumor. She has two cousins,  from the mother's side, who had breast cancer; one was diagnosed  at the age of ___ and the other was diagnosed at the age of ___.  Her maternal grandmother also had breast cancer but she is not  sure at what age she had. On her father's side, her father was a  love and only child, and she does not know anything about her  paternal grandparents.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with a history of DVT/PE, colitis, hypercholesterolemia, and other medical conditions, presenting with sudden onset abdominal pain, nausea, and a "pop" in her left lower abdomen. The pain is crampy, localized to the bilateral lower quadrants, and has been increasing in intensity. She also reports mild low-grade fevers and has had a normal bowel movement without blood or diarrhea. Given her history of colitis and diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon, I need to consider possible causes of abdominal pain such as diverticulitis, bowel obstruction, or other complications related to her underlying conditions.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The electrolyte panel and liver function tests are largely within normal limits. The urinalysis shows a small amount of protein and a few red blood cells, but no evidence of infection. The INR is elevated at 2.4, which is consistent with the patient's use of Coumadin. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, I would like to order some additional tests to help determine the cause of her abdominal pain.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT axial imaging was obtained through the abdomen and pelvis following the administration of intravenous contrast material. Coronal and sagittal reformats were completed.  **CT ABDOMEN/PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:** The visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable. A small granuloma at the right lung base is stable from prior exam. There is minimal atelectasis at the right lung base. There is no pleural effusion. There is a large hiatal hernia. The liver enhances homogenously without any focal lesions. There is no intra or extra-hepatic biliary dilitation. The portal vein is patent. The gallbladder, pancreas, and spleen are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis. There are small hypodensities in the left kidney that are too small to characterize but stable from prior exam. The adrenal glands are unremarkable. The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable except for a stable duodenal diverticulum. There is mild atherosclerotic disease of the abdominal aorta. There is a large amount of pneumoperitoneum. Evaluation of the colon demonstrates multiple sigmoid diverticula with stranding adjacent to a diverticulum in the proximal sigmoid colon consistent with acute ____. Image ___:31 shows what most likely represents the offending diverticulum. There is no evidence of abscess, colovesicular fistula or thrombophlebitis. The appendix is visualized and is normal. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The bladder is unremarkable without intravesicular air. The visualized rectum, uterus, and right ovary are unremarkable. The left ovary shows mild loss of fat plane between the ovary and the colon. There is no free fluid within the abdomen or pelvis.  **OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:** There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions seen. There are mild degenerative changes in the lumbar spine."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan with contrast shows a large amount of pneumoperitoneum, which is consistent with a perforated viscus. The scan also shows multiple sigmoid diverticula with stranding adjacent to a diverticulum in the proximal sigmoid colon, consistent with acute diverticulitis. Given the patient's symptoms and imaging results, I believe that the most likely diagnosis is acute diverticulitis with perforation.

Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal tenderness, Rebound tenderness, Guarding

ToolMessage:
"Vitals: GEN: A&O, NAD  HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, mild TTP bilateral lower quadrants, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses, tympanic. DRE: normal tone, no gross or occult blood Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination shows mild tenderness to palpation in the bilateral lower quadrants, but no rebound tenderness or guarding. The absence of rebound tenderness or guarding suggests that the patient may not have a severe perforation, but the presence of pneumoperitoneum on the CT scan suggests that there is still a significant concern for a perforated viscus. Given the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, I believe that the most likely diagnosis is acute diverticulitis with perforation.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute diverticulitis with perforation
2. Bowel obstruction
3. Abscess
4. Colitis
5. Gastroenteritis
Treatment: The patient should be admitted to the hospital and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. She should also be made NPO and have a nasogastric tube inserted to decompress the stomach. Surgical consultation should be obtained to discuss the possibility of surgical intervention. The patient's anticoagulation should be reversed and she should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis or worsening abdominal pain.
