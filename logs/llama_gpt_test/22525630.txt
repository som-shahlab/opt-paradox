HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/ no PMHx presents with 6 days of periumbilical pain which progressively migrated into her RLQ approximately two days ago. Pain was not associated with fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, chills, or anorexia. Given the persistence of her  pain, she presented to ___ for further workup and evaluation.   ROS: as per HPI, otherwise denies weight loss, night sweats, constipation, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, prior similar episodes   Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with periumbilical pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is a classic symptom of appendicitis. However, the absence of fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and other systemic symptoms is unusual for appendicitis. A thorough evaluation, including laboratory tests and imaging studies, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of RLQ pain.

Lab Interpretation: None (no laboratory values provided)
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: Complete Blood Count (CBC), Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Creatinine, Electrolyte Panel, Urinalysis, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-Reactive Protein (CRP)

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count, which makes appendicitis less likely, but not impossible. The absence of leukocytosis (elevated white blood cell count) and other abnormal laboratory findings does not rule out other possible causes of right lower quadrant pain, such as ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy, or intestinal obstruction. Further evaluation, including imaging studies, is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging studies, Abdominal Ultrasound and Pelvic Ultrasound, are not available in the provided list of imaging studies. The available imaging study is a CT Abdomen & Pelvis with Contrast."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms of periumbilical pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant, along with the normal laboratory results, suggest that an imaging study is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. A CT Abdomen & Pelvis with Contrast can help identify possible causes of right lower quadrant pain, such as appendicitis, ovarian cysts, or intestinal obstruction.
Lab Interpretation: None (no new laboratory values provided)
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen & Pelvis with Contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"CT Abdomen & Pelvis with Contrast,\" matches the available imaging study titled \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for the matching study:  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen pelvis  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 224 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN:  HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. Appendix is abnormal with mucosal hyperemia, fluid-filled and dilated up to 11 mm with mild periappendiceal fat stranding and fluid. No definite appendicolith. No free air or drainable collection.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is trace free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Uterus is unremarkable. Right adnexal cyst measuring up to 2.2 cm is noted.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___ ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 16:55, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT Abdomen & Pelvis with Contrast shows an abnormal appendix with mucosal hyperemia, fluid-filled and dilated up to 11 mm with mild periappendiceal fat stranding and fluid, which is consistent with appendicitis. The presence of a right adnexal cyst measuring up to 2.2 cm is also noted, but it is not likely the cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with acute appendicitis.
Lab Interpretation: None (no new laboratory values provided)
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination findings, including tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, McBurney's point tenderness, and positive Rovsing's sign, are consistent with acute appendicitis. The presence of a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding on the CT scan, along with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Right adnexal cyst
3. Gastroenteritis
4. Intestinal obstruction
5. Ovarian torsion
Treatment: The patient should undergo urgent surgical appendectomy to remove the inflamed appendix. Antibiotics should be administered preoperatively to reduce the risk of postoperative infection. Postoperative care should include pain management, monitoring for signs of infection or complications, and follow-up with the surgical team to ensure a smooth recovery.
