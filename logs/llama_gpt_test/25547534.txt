HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old female who presents with RLQ since  the morning of ___.  Patient initially felt diffuse  reflux-like discomfort for several hours until a sudden sharp  burst of pain in the RLQ, ___, which lasted several minutes.  Pain gradually declined in severity to ___ and persisted.  Patient experienced another episode of ___ RLQ pain 1 hour  later, which lasted minutes and returned to steady ___ level.   Patient arrived in ___ ED and received IV morphine.  At time  of examination, patient reports ___ RLQ pain.  Pain is not  exacerbated or alleviated by activity and is unrelated to food.   Patient denies fever, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, change  in stools. Denies any change in urine or urinary habits.   Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: Denies tobacco use. Reports social alcohol use ___  times/month). Denies illicit drug use.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, which is a common symptom of several conditions, including appendicitis, ovarian cysts, and intestinal obstruction. The patient's pain started as diffuse reflux-like discomfort and then localized to the RLQ with a sudden sharp burst of pain, which is consistent with appendicitis. However, the patient's denial of fever, chills, sweats, nausea, vomiting, and changes in stools or urine makes it less likely. The patient's social history and family history are also important to consider. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I need to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 9.0 K/uL, which may indicate an inflammatory process. The urinalysis results show the presence of leukocytes and few bacteria, which could suggest a urinary tract infection. However, the patient denies any changes in urine or urinary habits. The absence of liver function tests and lipase results makes it difficult to rule out other conditions such as pancreatitis or liver disease. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I need to order imaging studies.

Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal CT scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging studies are an Abdominal Ultrasound and an Abdominal CT scan. From the available imaging studies, the CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT) includes the abdomen, which matches the requested Abdominal CT scan. Here is the full report for the CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT acquired axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis after administration of 130 cc Omnipaque intravenous contrast material. Enteric contrast was also given. Coronal and sagittal reformats reviewed.  **FINDINGS:**  - The lower chest is unremarkable. - **ABDOMEN:** The liver enhances homogeneously and is without focal abnormality noting that the dome was not imaged. The gallbladder and biliary tree appear normal. The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands appear normal. The kidneys enhance normally and excrete contrast symmetrically. The stomach, duodenum, and abdominal loops of small and large bowel are of normal caliber, without wall thickening, or associated mass. The appendix is hyperemic, dilated to 10 mm, features mural edema, and surrounding fat stranding (602b:28, 2a:54). As seen on the ultrasound, there is a small amount of minimally complex free fluid tracking into the pelvis. There is no fluid collection. There is no pneumoperitoneum. The portal, splenic, and mesenteric veins are patent. The abdominal aorta is not enlarged and its main branches are patent. There is no retroperitoneal, periportal, or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. - **PELVIS:** The rectum and sigmoid are normal. There is minimal diffuse bladder wall thickening. The uterus and ovaries are normal. There is no pelvic mass. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. - **MUSCULOSKELETAL:** There are no lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions concerning for malignancy."
