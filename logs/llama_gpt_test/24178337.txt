HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ otherwise healthy presenting with a ___ days of worsening abdominal pain that localizes to the RLQ. She states that she  has a decreased appetite, nausea, and chills, but denies fevers, vomiting, or diarrhea. +sick contacts.      Past Medical History: PMH: None PSH: Hysterectomy     Social History: ___ Family History: ?brother with appendiceal mass requiring right colectomy


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with worsening abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), decreased appetite, nausea, chills, and a history of a possible family member with an appendiceal mass. These symptoms are suggestive of acute appendicitis, especially given the localization of pain to the RLQ and the presence of nausea and chills. However, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other causes of abdominal pain, further evaluation is necessary.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a left shift, indicating a possible infectious or inflammatory process. The rest of the CBC values are within normal limits. The BUN, creatinine, and electrolyte panel are also within normal limits, suggesting no significant renal dysfunction or electrolyte imbalance. The liver function tests (LFTs) are largely normal, with the exception of a slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase, which can be seen in various conditions, including bone disorders or liver disease. The lipase level is within normal limits, which makes pancreatitis less likely. However, the absence of amylase, ESR, and CRP results limits the interpretation of these findings.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study is an Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan, which matches the available imaging study: CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT). Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT abdomen and pelvis  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Total DLP (Body) = 820 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Other than mild bibasilar atelectasis, the incompletely imaged lower lungs are clear. Calcifications in the breasts could be biopsy clips or coarse calcifications from fibroadenomas. No evidence of a pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. No evidence of focal lesions. No evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. No ascites.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. No peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. Tiny hypodensity in the right mid-upper renal pole is too small to accurately characterize but statistically most likely a cyst (series 2, image 26). A similar tiny hypodensity in the left mid pole cortex is also too small to characterize (series 2, image 25). No hydronephrosis or perinephric abnormality.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The terminal ileum is normal. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is fluid-filled and dilated up to 12 mm with wall thickening and hyperenhancement, consistent with ____ (series 2 thyroid 61). No evidence of an appendicular. Surrounding mesenteric fat stranding is moderate. No evidence of macro perforation. No drainable fluid collection. No bowel obstruction.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. No free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The reproductive organs are unremarkable.  **LYMPH NODES:** Prominent mesenteric nodes in the right lower quadrant are presumed reactive in the setting of ____. No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** No abdominal aortic aneurysm. No significant atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** No evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Degenerative changes at L4-L5 and L5-S1 are moderate.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  **NOTIFICATION:** The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___ ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 4:50 ___, 1 minutes after discovery of the findings."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows a dilated appendix with wall thickening and hyperenhancement, consistent with acute appendicitis. The surrounding mesenteric fat stranding is moderate, indicating inflammation. There is no evidence of macro perforation or a drainable fluid collection. The rest of the abdominal and pelvic organs are unremarkable. Given these findings, along with the patient's symptoms of worsening abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant, decreased appetite, nausea, and chills, the most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis.
Lab Interpretation: None (no new laboratory values provided)
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign

ToolMessage:
"Exam on admission: GEN: A&Ox3, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR  PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l  ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender to palpation RLQ, with guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused  Exam"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination is consistent with acute appendicitis, showing tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, guarding, and normoactive bowel sounds. The presence of these signs, combined with the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings, confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Mesenteric lymphadenitis
4. Intestinal obstruction
5. Diverticulitis
Treatment: The patient should undergo urgent surgical consultation for possible appendectomy. In the meantime, the patient should be made nil per os (NPO), and intravenous fluids should be started to prevent dehydration. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered to cover for possible bacterial infection. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of perforation or peritonitis, which would require immediate surgical intervention. Post-operatively, the patient should be managed with pain control, wound care, and monitoring for any signs of infection or complications.
