HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with RLQ abdominal pain since this morning. This never happen to her before. Pt reports her pain as ___, constant, no radiation, movements make the pain worst. Last BM was this morning and it was normal. Denies N/V/F, reports chills.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: HTN, depression  Past Surgical History: Denies    Social History: ___ Family History: Family History: brother with AAA, mother died of stroke


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain that started this morning, which is constant and worsens with movement. She also reports chills but denies nausea, vomiting, fever, and changes in bowel movements. Given the location and nature of the pain, along with the absence of other gastrointestinal symptoms, a differential diagnosis could include appendicitis, given the classic presentation of RLQ pain. However, other causes such as ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, or even a gastrointestinal issue like diverticulitis cannot be ruled out without further evaluation. The patient's past medical history of hypertension and depression, and her family history of a brother with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and a mother who died of a stroke, are noted but may not be directly relevant to her current acute presentation.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count (14.2 K/uL) with a predominance of neutrophils (86.0%), which could indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The rest of the CBC parameters are within normal limits. The Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) results are largely unremarkable, with no significant electrolyte imbalances or abnormalities in renal function tests. The urinalysis does not show any evidence of infection (negative for nitrite, leukocytes, and bilirubin) or other abnormalities that might suggest a urinary tract issue as the cause of her pain. 

Given the lack of specific findings pointing to another cause and the clinical presentation of RLQ abdominal pain, appendicitis remains a consideration, although the absence of more pronounced leukocytosis or other specific markers of infection (like elevated CRP, which is not provided) might suggest looking into other differential diagnoses as well.

"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis following administration of IV and oral contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed.  **FINDINGS:**  - The imaged lung bases are clear. - Visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable. - The liver enhances homogeneously and there are no focal liver lesions. - The gallbladder is normal. - The pancreas is normal. - The spleen is normal. - The adrenal glands are normal. - The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically. There is a 1.2 cm cyst in the right lower pole. No hydronephrosis. - There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. - The stomach and small bowel are normal. - The appendix measures 7 mm in diameter and there is mild surrounding fat stranding. The appendix is mildly hyperemic. There is a focus of air in the distal appendix and possibly a small amount of oral contrast. There is no evidence of perforation. No abscess. - There is sigmoid diverticulosis but no evidence of diverticulitis. Otherwise, the colon is unremarkable.  **Pelvis:** - The rectum is unremarkable. - The uterus and adnexa are normal. - The bladder and terminal ureters are unremarkable. - There is no free fluid in the pelvis. - The bowel and there is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **Intra-abdominal vasculature is patent. There is no acute bone abnormality.**"
