HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ PMH significant for metastatic melanoma (currently starting  on pembrolizumab), who presents to ED with CC acute abdominal  pain. He reports 2 days of abdominal cramping, constipation,  most recently diarrhea. Additionally, he endorses fevers (Tmax 101.2)  earlier today. He denies any nausea or vomiting.  He has not had  any blood in his stools.  Of note, he had recently been on treatment for URI.   ROS:   (+) per HPI    Past Medical History: Past Medical History:   CAD and MI (___) s/p cardiac stent Atrial fibrillation on Xarelto  CHF  OSA on CPAP HTN HLD TIA  Colonic polyps Metastatic melanoma  Port placement   Social History: ___ Family History: Family History:   Maternal aunt - breast cancer ___ cousin - breast cancer ___ grandmother - skin cancer Brother - brain tumor


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, fevers, and a history of metastatic melanoma. Given the patient's complex medical history, including CAD, MI, atrial fibrillation, CHF, and metastatic melanoma, it is essential to consider multiple potential causes for the abdominal pain. The recent treatment for URI and the initiation of pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy agent, may also be relevant.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a potential infection or inflammatory process. The liver function tests reveal elevated ALT and AST, suggesting liver injury or inflammation. The lipase level is within normal limits, making pancreatitis less likely. The lactate level is slightly elevated, which may indicate tissue hypoperfusion or sepsis. Given the patient's complex medical history and the presence of metastatic melanoma, it is essential to consider multiple potential causes for the abdominal pain, including infection, bowel obstruction, or tumor-related complications.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal CT scan with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Acquisition sequence:   1) Stationary Acquisition 7.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 33.7 mGy (Body) DLP = 16.9 mGy-cm.   2) Spiral Acquisition 5.2 s, 56.9 cm; CTDIvol = 16.9 mGy (Body) DLP = 963.7 mGy-cm.   Total DLP (Body) = 981 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**    **LOWER CHEST:** Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. Coronary artery calcifications are present. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**    **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous low attenuation throughout consistent with steatosis. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right adrenal gland is normal in size and shape. The left adrenal gland contains heterogeneously enhancing 2.6 x 2.1 cm mass, smaller than on prior examination in ___ measured 3.7 x 3.9 cm (02:29).  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is unremarkable. A small duodenal diverticulum noted. No obstruction. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon is noted, without evidence of wall thickening and fat stranding. The appendix is normal. In the left abdomen, an enhancing small bowel diverticulum demonstrates extensive surrounding fat stranding and several adjacent locules of gas which appear to be extraluminal although exact location is somewhat difficult to determine due to streak artifact and beam hardening from overlying soft tissues (02:56, 2:54, 602b:79). There is no free fluid or drainable fluid collection. The adjacent small bowel a have slightly edematous walls (601b:27) but no evidence of pneumatosis. The remaining small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Moderate atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

AIMessage:
Thought: The abdominal CT scan with contrast reveals several important findings. The liver shows homogenous low attenuation consistent with steatosis, but no focal lesions. The pancreas is normal, making pancreatitis less likely. The left adrenal gland contains a heterogeneously enhancing mass, which is smaller than on prior examination. The gastrointestinal findings are significant, with a small bowel diverticulum demonstrating extensive surrounding fat stranding and several adjacent locules of gas, suggesting a possible diverticulitis or bowel perforation. The presence of metastatic melanoma and the patient's recent initiation of pembrolizumab, an immunotherapy agent, may also be relevant to the patient's condition.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination reveals abdominal tenderness, particularly in the lower abdomen on the left, with marginal rebound tenderness. The patient is not frankly peritonitic, but the findings suggest a possible intra-abdominal process, such as diverticulitis or bowel perforation, which is consistent with the CT scan findings. The patient's complex medical history, including metastatic melanoma and recent initiation of pembrolizumab, may also be relevant to the patient's condition.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Diverticulitis
2. Bowel perforation
3. Intra-abdominal infection
4. Tumor-related complications (e.g., bowel obstruction or perforation)
5. Pembrolizumab-related adverse effects (e.g., colitis or pneumonitis)
Treatment: The patient should be admitted to the hospital for further management. Treatment may include:
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential intra-abdominal infection
* Bowel rest and supportive care (e.g., fluids, pain management)
* Possible surgical intervention if bowel perforation or obstruction is suspected
* Close monitoring of the patient's condition, including vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging studies
* Consideration of pembrolizumab-related adverse effects and potential modification of the patient's treatment plan as needed.
