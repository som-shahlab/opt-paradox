HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ y/o M with sudden onset epigastric pain that started yesterday ___ @14:00. The pain radiated to the RLQ over the course of the day and is currently localized to the RLQ.  When asked to point to the location of the pain, the patient  indicated an area just lateral and inferior to the umbilicus, yet slightly medial and superior to ___'s point. The patient rates the pain ___ before coming to the ED and ___ @ 20:30 after administration of 4 mg IV morphine @ 18:46. The pain was associated with nausea, anorexia, chills and a fever of ___ F upon arrival to the ED. The patient received 1000 mg acetaminophen at the ED for the fever @ 18:55. The patient  denies any rigors, diarrhea, emesis and any history of abdominal surgery. The pain is worse when the patient moves around and on the car ride over to the ED. The pain improved slightly with 3 Tylenol extra strength, a bowel movement at 10 am this morning (___) and when lying on the right side.    Past Medical History: diabetes type II, hypercholesterolemia, HTN, cardiomyopathy  (EF=50% ___, chronic kidney disease (baseline creatinine ~2)    Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with sudden onset epigastric pain that radiated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is a common presentation for acute appendicitis, but the location of the pain is slightly atypical. The patient's pain is worsened by movement and improved by lying on the right side, which could suggest a possible inflammatory process. The patient's past medical history of diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, cardiomyopathy, and chronic kidney disease may increase the risk of certain complications, but does not directly point to a specific diagnosis. To further evaluate the patient's condition, laboratory tests and imaging studies are necessary.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The patient's creatinine level is also elevated, which is consistent with their known chronic kidney disease. The liver function tests are largely within normal limits. The lipase level is within normal limits, which makes pancreatitis less likely. To further evaluate the patient's condition, imaging studies are necessary.

"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Acquisition sequence:   1) Stationary Acquisition 5.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 24.1 mGy (Body) DLP = 12.0 mGy-cm.   2) Spiral Acquisition 5.4 s, 59.0 cm; CTDIvol = 16.8 mGy (Body) DLP = 991.6 mGy-cm.   Total DLP (Body) = 1,004 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** There is a hypodense lesion in segment 6 of the liver with peripheral nodular enhancement, likely hemangioma measuring 1.8 x 1.3 cm (series 2: Image 34). However, this lesion is not fully characterized on this exam. The liver otherwise demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There are multiple subcentimeter hypodensities in the left kidney, which are not fully characterized but likely cysts. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The appendix is dilated, measuring up to 1.5 cm in diameter, with internal hyperdensities, likely appendicolith(s). Periappendiceal fat stranding and a small amount of fluid is seen tracking along the fascia. No extraluminal gas or drainable fluid collection is seen. There is adjacent mild reactive thickening of the small bowel. No bowel obstruction is seen.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Several lymph nodes are noted in the bilateral inguinal region, which are not pathologically enlarged. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Minimal atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  **NOTIFICATION:** The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___ ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 9:26 ___, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings."
