HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ presents with one day of abdominal pain. Initially was  diffuse, crampy pain, and last night had diffuse, watery  diarrhea and tenesmus (baseline has constipation). Denies bloody  stools. Thereafter, her pain became more focal and localized to the RLQ  with continued diffuse pain as well. +nausea/vomiting/dry  heaves, denies fever/chills/recent antibiotics, sick contacts.    Past Medical History: PMH: anxiety, depression, chronic pain, fibromyalgia   PSH: L salpingo-oophorectomy     Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain that initially was diffuse and crampy, then became more focal and localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) with continued diffuse pain. The patient also experienced diffuse, watery diarrhea and tenesmus, which is a sensation of incomplete defecation. The patient's symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, and dry heaves, suggest a possible gastrointestinal or abdominal issue. The patient's past medical history of chronic pain and fibromyalgia may contribute to the abdominal pain, but it is essential to consider other potential causes, such as appendicitis, given the localization of pain to the RLQ.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count (14.9 K/uL) with a neutrophil predominance (78.0%), indicating a possible infectious or inflammatory process. The patient's glucose level is slightly elevated (105.0 mg/dL), which may be related to stress or other factors. The urinalysis results show a few bacteria, but no significant evidence of a urinary tract infection. The lipase level is within normal limits (16.0 IU/L), which makes pancreatitis less likely.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Ultrasound,\" is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. However, the \"Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan\" matches the requested imaging. Here is the full report for the CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Total DLP (Body) = 832 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The right kidney is atrophic. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The retrocecal appendix is dilated with surrounding fat stranding consistent with acute uncomplicated appendicitis. An appendicolith is seen at the base of the appendix.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast shows evidence of acute uncomplicated appendicitis, with a dilated retrocecal appendix and surrounding fat stranding. An appendicolith is also seen at the base of the appendix. The rest of the abdominal and pelvic organs are unremarkable. Given the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and the CT scan findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination reveals acute tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) of the abdomen, which is consistent with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but the patient is anxious and tearful. The rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Intestinal obstruction
4. Inflammatory bowel disease
5. Diverticulitis
Treatment: The patient should undergo an urgent appendectomy to remove the inflamed appendix. The patient should also receive intravenous antibiotics to cover for possible bacterial infection. Pain management and anti-emetic medications should be administered as needed. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of complications, such as perforation or abscess formation. Post-operative care should include wound care, pain management, and monitoring for any signs of infection or other complications.
