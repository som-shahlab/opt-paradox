HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with a history of asthma and HLD p/w 1  day of abdominal pain. The pain started at 6:30am on the day of  her presentation and it was diffusely over her entire abdomen  and worsened throughout the day. It had subsided since coming to  the ED, and her abdomen on presentation was non-tender, except  when she put pressure on her RLQ. She was nauseated and vomited  yellow foamy liquid this morning, but no longer feels nauseated.  She last ate the night before presentation. She last passed  flatus the morning of presentation, and has not had a BM for two  days. She has never had this type of pain in the past. Her LMP  was approximately 1 month ago.    Past Medical History: PMHx: Asthma, HLD, obesity  PSHx: none   Family History: Noncontributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a history of abdominal pain that started diffusely and worsened throughout the day, but has since subsided. The pain is now localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) with tenderness on palpation. She also experienced nausea, vomiting, and has not had a bowel movement for two days. Given her symptoms and past medical history, it is essential to consider various differential diagnoses, including appendicitis, bowel obstruction, and other gastrointestinal issues. 

To further evaluate the patient's condition, laboratory tests and imaging studies are necessary to rule out potential causes of her symptoms.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (18.5 K/uL) with a high percentage of neutrophils (87.5%), indicating a potential infectious or inflammatory process. The basic metabolic panel reveals a slightly elevated glucose level (102.0 mg/dL) and a low bicarbonate level (17.0 mEq/L), which may suggest a metabolic acidosis. The liver function tests are largely within normal limits. The urinalysis shows the presence of protein, glucose, and ketones, with an abnormal number of leukocytes and epithelial cells.

To further evaluate the patient's condition, it is essential to consider imaging studies to visualize the abdominal organs and potential sources of pain.

"The requested imaging study is an Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan, which matches the available imaging study: CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST. Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Total DLP (Body) = 711 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver appears slightly hypoattenuating, suggesting fatting infiltration. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The retrocecal appendix is fluid-filled and dilated measuring up to 10 mm (series 601, image 37). There is mucosal hyperemia and surrounding fat stranding, findings which are consistent with ____. Tiny adjacent lymph nodes are likely inflammatory (02:46). No associated abscess or evidence of perforation.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The uterus is unremarkable in appearance. Right ovary is within normal limits. Note is made of a corpus luteal cyst in the left ovary.  **NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Incidental note is made of osteitis.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast reveals a dilated appendix (up to 10 mm) with surrounding fat stranding and mucosal hyperemia, consistent with appendicitis. The presence of a fluid-filled appendix and adjacent inflammatory lymph nodes further supports this diagnosis. The rest of the abdominal organs, including the liver, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract, appear normal. The corpus luteal cyst in the left ovary is an incidental finding.

Given the imaging findings and the patient's clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Intestinal obstruction
4. Diverticulitis
5. Inflammatory bowel disease

Treatment: The patient should undergo urgent surgical consultation for potential appendectomy. In the meantime, the patient should be made nil per os (NPO) and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as cefoxitin or cefotaxime, to cover for potential bacterial infection. Pain management with acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be considered. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of perforation or abscess formation, which may require additional interventions.
