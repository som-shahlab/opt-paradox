HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Pt is an ___  on Pradaxa who presented to the ___ ED with a  6day hx of mild RUQ pain, poor PO intake and hypotension.  She  states that she has a very rich meal 6days  ago for a family  celebration and felt very full and unwell afterwards.  She had  RUQ abdominal pain relieved by antacids and burning.  She has taken very little PO since that time.  She has  had loose stools as well but took Immodium and has not stooled  in the 2d prior to presentation.  For the past two days she has  also experienced profound hypotension and has been unable to  stand without dizziness and risk of fall.  She was seen by her  doctor today and was found to be hypotensive with BP 80/38, HR  48-52 and irreg.  She was afebrile with FSBS 148 and guiac neg.     Past Medical History: HTN   Glucose intolerance   OA   Hypothyroid   AVNRT--rx verapamil and atenolol   Skin Ca: nose. squamous cell   GI: non bleeding grade 3 hemorrhoids, erosive gastritis   Transitional Carcinoma of Bladder: rx locally without recurrence   Social History: ___ Family History: Breast ca: sister, mat aunt.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient is presenting with a 6-day history of mild right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, poor oral intake, and hypotension, which suggests a possible gastrointestinal or abdominal issue. The patient's symptoms started after a rich meal, and she has been experiencing relief with antacids, which could indicate a peptic ulcer disease or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, the patient's hypotension, low heart rate, and inability to stand without dizziness are concerning for a more severe condition, such as bleeding or sepsis. The patient's past medical history of erosive gastritis and non-bleeding grade 3 hemorrhoids increases the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding. The patient is also on Pradaxa, which is an anticoagulant that increases the risk of bleeding.

If you need further information or additional tests, please let me know!"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate a possible infection or inflammation. The hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are within normal limits, which suggests that the patient is not actively bleeding. The platelet count is also within normal limits. The basic metabolic panel shows a slightly elevated glucose level, which is consistent with the patient's history of glucose intolerance. The liver function tests show mildly elevated AST and ALT levels, which could indicate liver injury or disease. The coagulation studies show an elevated INR, which is consistent with the patient's use of Pradaxa.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Ultrasound,\" matches the available imaging study \"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound).\" Here is the full report:  **LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound):**  **FINDINGS:** The liver is normal in echogenicity with no focal lesions present. The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The common bile duct measures 5 mm and is normal. The gallbladder shows severe gallbladder wall thickening measuring up to 9 mm with an irregular heterogeneous wall and pericholecystic fluid along with stones and sludge. The patient had a positive sonographic ___ sign. The right kidney has a simple anechoic thin-walled 2.6 x 2.6 x 2.7 cm cyst in the upper pole."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's abdominal ultrasound shows severe gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, stones, and sludge, which are consistent with acute cholecystitis. The patient's symptoms of right upper quadrant pain, poor oral intake, and hypotension are also consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of a positive sonographic Murphy's sign further supports the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.
