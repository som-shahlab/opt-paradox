HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ female with RLQ pain which began yesterday. The pain was  initially located ___ before localizing to the RLQ.   She has had no previous episodes.  Pain is undulating, dull and  sharp (up to ___, increased when walking.  It does not  radiate.  She also reports nausea and anorexia without vomiting.   Her last meal was toast this morning.  ROS: (+) per HPI (-) Denies fevers night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue/malaise/lethargy, vomiting, hematemesis, bloating, cramping, melena, BRBPR, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, edema, urinary frequency, urgency   Past Medical History: PMH: Inflammatory bowel syndrome  PSH: None   Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, nausea, and anorexia, which are classic symptoms of appendicitis. The pain started as a diffuse abdominal pain before localizing to the RLQ, which is also consistent with appendicitis. The patient's past medical history of inflammatory bowel syndrome could be a contributing factor, but the symptoms she is experiencing now are more suggestive of an acute abdominal condition. To further evaluate the patient, laboratory tests and imaging studies would be helpful.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count, which could suggest that the patient does not have a significant infection or inflammation. However, the patient's symptoms of RLQ pain, nausea, and anorexia are still concerning for appendicitis or another acute abdominal condition. The liver function tests are within normal limits, which makes liver disease less likely. The urinalysis results are also largely unremarkable, which decreases the likelihood of a urinary tract infection. To further evaluate the patient, imaging studies such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis would be helpful.

Action: imaging
Action Input: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging, \"CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT): CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS.\" Here is the full report for that study:  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: Helical imaging was performed from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis after intravenous and oral contrast administration. Sagittal and coronal reformats were prepared.  CT ABDOMEN: Partially visualized lung bases demonstrate bibasilar dependent atelectasis and partially visualized heart appears normal. The spleen, adrenals, pancreas, gallbladder, liver, and kidneys appear normal. No free air or free fluid is present. Bowel appears normal.  CT PELVIS: Oral contrast did not transit into the cecum limiting evaluation of the appendix. However, there is a small amount of simple fluid near the cecal base. The appendix is top normal in size measuring 7 mm (301B:13). There are no drainable fluid collections in the pelvis. There is trace fluid in the cul-de-sac. Uterus and adnexa appear normal. The bladder is normal. There is no adenopathy.  BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious-appearing sclerotic or lytic lesions."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows that the appendix is slightly enlarged, measuring 7 mm in diameter, which is a borderline size for appendicitis. The presence of a small amount of simple fluid near the cecal base also raises suspicion for appendicitis. However, the oral contrast did not transit into the cecum, limiting the evaluation of the appendix. The rest of the abdominal and pelvic organs appear normal. Given the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings, appendicitis is still a possible diagnosis, but further evaluation is needed to confirm.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination shows tenderness to light palpation in the RLQ, which is consistent with appendicitis. However, the absence of rebound tenderness, guarding, and Rovsing's sign makes the diagnosis less likely. The patient's temperature is normal, and the rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Inflammatory bowel disease flare
3. Viral gastroenteritis
4. Intestinal obstruction
5. Mesenteric lymphadenitis

Treatment: The patient should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment.
