HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ ___ year old  woman with past medical history of hypertension, gastritis,  kidney lesion, and menorrhagia status post hysterectomy/BSO who  presents with right lower quadrant abdominal pain x 3.5 days.  Three days prior to presentation, she developed right lower  quadrant abdominal pain that has worsened.  The right lower  quadrant abdominal pain has been accompanied by nausea, chills,  lightheadedness, weakness, and decreased PO intake due to the  pain. She denies fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, BRBPR, melena,  weight loss, and changes in urinary symptoms.   Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Hypertension, Gastritis, Kidney lesion  left upper pole, right adrenal nodule, lichensclerosis,  constipation, right breast fibroadenoma,     Past Surgical History: C-section x1, Exploratory laparotomy in  ___, Hysterectomy and BSO in ___, Right Breast biopsy    Allergies: NKDA      Social History: ___ Family History: Mother - high cholesterol, dementia. Father - HTN.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, chills, lightheadedness, weakness, and decreased oral intake. Her past medical history includes hypertension, gastritis, kidney lesion, and menorrhagia status post hysterectomy/BSO. Given her symptoms and history, it's essential to consider possible causes of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or an ovarian cyst (although less likely given her history of hysterectomy and BSO).

If you need further information or clarification, feel free to ask!"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count, which might suggest that there is no significant infection or inflammation. The liver function tests are also within normal limits. The urinalysis results show moderate leukocytes, which could indicate a urinary tract infection, but the absence of nitrite and bacteria in the urine makes this less likely. The patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and chills could be related to a variety of causes, including a kidney stone, diverticulitis, or an ovarian remnant syndrome (given her history of hysterectomy and BSO).

Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast,\" matches the available imaging study titled \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for the matching study:  **EXAMINATION:** CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. No oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Total DLP (Body) = 674 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Imaged lung bases are clear. The imaged portion of the heart is unremarkable.  **ABDOMEN:**  - **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.    - **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.    - **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.    - **ADRENALS:** There is a right adrenal nodule measuring 1.1 cm, stable in size from MRI abdomen ___. Please note, this nodule was previously characterized as adenoma. The left adrenal gland is unremarkable.    - **URINARY:** There are subcentimeter intermediate density cysts in the upper pole of the bilateral kidneys that are stable in size from the most recent comparison study. The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no hydronephrosis or perinephric abnormality.    - **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The fluid-filled appendix is dilated with hyperemic thickened walls, with a maximum diameter of 12 mm. There is no significant adjacent fluid or fat stranding.    **PELVIS:**  - The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.    - **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** Uterus appears small, question supracervical hysterectomy versus atrophy. No adnexal mass is seen.    - **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.    - **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild vascular calcifications of the infrarenal aorta and bilateral common iliac arteries.    - **BONES:** Mild degenerative changes in lower thoracic and lumbar vertebral bodies. There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.    - **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast shows a dilated appendix with hyperemic thickened walls, which is consistent with appendicitis. The patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and chills are also consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of a right adrenal nodule, which was previously characterized as an adenoma, is noted but is unlikely to be related to the patient's current symptoms.

Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination shows tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, which is consistent with appendicitis. The absence of rebound tenderness and guarding suggests that the patient may not have a perforated appendix. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, combined with the CT scan results, support a diagnosis of appendicitis.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian remnant syndrome
3. Diverticulitis
4. Kidney stone
5. Urinary tract infection
Treatment: The patient should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and should undergo an appendectomy as soon as possible. The patient should also be monitored for any signs of perforation or abscess formation, and should be managed with pain control and bowel rest as needed.
