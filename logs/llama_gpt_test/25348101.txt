Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w hx HTN, anxiety p/w abdominal pain x 2 days. In usual  state of health until day prior to presentation when she  developed epigastric abdominal discomfort. Over the next ___  pain migrated to RLQ. Described as ___ severity, constant,  non-radiating. Worse w movement. No alleviating factors. No  prior episodes of similar pain. Endorses associated chills, anorexia,  nausea and non-bloody emesis. Came to ED for evaluation. Surgery  consult obtained.   On surgery eval, patient relays hx as above. Minimal po intake  since onset of pain. No po intake for greater than 6 hours.  +Flatus/BM. Denies fever, chest pain, shortness of breath,  constipation, diarrhea, blood per rectum, dysuria.   Past Medical History: PMH: HTN, anxiety/depression, insomnia  PSH: Inguinal hernia repair, exploratory laparoscopy for fertility workup   Social History: ___ Family History: No fam hx GI malignancy of IBD


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a 2-day history of abdominal pain that initially started in the epigastric region and then migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). The pain is described as constant, non-radiating, and worsens with movement. The patient also reports associated symptoms such as chills, anorexia, nausea, and non-bloody emesis. The patient's past medical history includes hypertension, anxiety/depression, and insomnia, and she has undergone previous surgeries, including an inguinal hernia repair and an exploratory laparoscopy for fertility workup. Given the acute onset of abdominal pain and the migration of pain to the RLQ, I need to consider possible causes such as appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, or other gastrointestinal pathologies.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count (14.6 K/uL) with a left shift, indicating a possible infectious or inflammatory process. The basic metabolic panel is largely unremarkable, with a slightly elevated glucose level (120 mg/dL). The liver function tests are within normal limits. The lipase level is normal (26 IU/L), which makes pancreatitis less likely. The urinalysis shows a hazy appearance, specific gravity of 1.02, and a pH of 8.0, with trace protein and glucose. The absence of leukocytes and nitrite in the urinalysis makes a urinary tract infection less likely. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, I need to consider other possible causes of abdominal pain, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or intestinal obstruction.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal CT scan with contrast, Chest X-ray

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study is an Abdominal CT scan with contrast, which matches the available imaging study: CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).  Here is the full report for the CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis.  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. IV Contrast: 130 mL Omnipaque. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. Oral contrast was administered.  DOSE: Acquisition sequence:  1) Stationary Acquisition 6.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 28.9 mGy (Body) DLP = 14.4 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 4.9 s, 53.0 cm; CTDIvol = 12.7 mGy (Body) DLP = 670.1 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 684 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN:  HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 1.1 cm left hepatic hypodensity (2:9) likely represents a cyst or hepatic hemangioma. Several smaller, subcentimeter hepatic hypodensities are too small to characterize but also likely cysts. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is fluid-filled and dilated up to 1.3 cm, containing numerous intraluminal appendicoliths and surrounding inflammatory change. Trace fluid is noted along the right pericolic gutter. However, there is no evidence of perforation or associated abscess formation.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. A small umbilical hernia containing fat is noted."

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Intestinal obstruction

Treatment: The patient should undergo urgent surgical consultation for possible appendectomy. Additionally, the patient should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for possible bacterial infection. The patient should also be kept nil per os (NPO) and receive intravenous fluids for hydration. Post-operatively, the patient should be monitored for signs of infection or other complications and receive pain management as needed.
