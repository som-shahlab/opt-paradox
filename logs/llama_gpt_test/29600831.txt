Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with history of gallstones  and DM type 2 who presents with right upper quadrant pain  radiating to her back. The pain began the evening of ___  ___ an hour after eating a meal of rice and cheese cake. The  pain persisted through the night, preventing her from sleeping. She vomited 6 times on ___ at which point the pain subsided,  and she was pain free until ___. She reported no blood in her  vomit. ___ evening she at a meal consisting of fish at 6 ___  and her RUQ abdominal pain started at 7 ___. She rated the pain  ___ at that time and could not find any position that relieved  the pain. She took Motrin for the pain that mildly reduced the  pain, which was a ___ upon arrival to ED. She denies any  diarrhea, dizziness, fever or chills in the past 3 days.     Past Medical History: Past Medical History: -Reactive follicular hyperplasia and progressive transformation of germinal centers (PTGC). Dx ___ -Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus -Hypertension -Cholelithiasis  Past Surgical History: -Right axillary lymph node biopsy ___    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother - ___ and HTN Father - HTN


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain radiating to her back, which began after eating a meal, and has a history of gallstones and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The pain persisted through the night, subsided after vomiting, and then recurred after eating another meal. This pattern suggests a possible gallbladder pathology, such as cholecystitis or a gallstone causing obstruction. Given the patient's history of gallstones, it is essential to investigate the current state of her gallbladder and biliary system.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a relatively normal complete blood count, blood chemistry, and liver function tests. The lipase level is slightly elevated, which could indicate pancreatic pathology, but it is not significantly high. The absence of amylase results makes it difficult to confirm pancreatitis. However, given the patient's history of gallstones and the recurrent RUQ pain, it is still possible that the patient has a gallbladder-related issue, such as cholecystitis or a gallstone causing obstruction.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Ultrasound,\" is not available in the provided list. The available imaging study is \"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound): RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND,\" which does not match the requested imaging."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results and medical history suggest a possible gallbladder-related issue, such as cholecystitis or a gallstone causing obstruction. The abdominal ultrasound is a crucial diagnostic tool to confirm the presence of gallstones, gallbladder inflammation, or other biliary pathologies.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Liver or Gallbladder US (Single Organ),\" matches the available imaging study \"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound).\" Here is the full report:  **LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound): RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND:**  The liver is mildly echogenic, which may reflect fatty deposition. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The common duct measures 4 mm. The gallbladder is tensely distended without mural edema or pericholecystic fluid. Two gallstones are seen measuring up to 1.7 cm. One may be impacted in the gallbladder neck. Sonographic ___ sign was unreliable in the setting of pain medication. The pancreas appears unremarkable, though the distal body and tail are not well seen."

AIMessage:
Thought: The ultrasound results confirm the presence of two gallstones, one of which may be impacted in the gallbladder neck, and a tensely distended gallbladder without mural edema or pericholecystic fluid. These findings, combined with the patient's history of gallstones and recurrent RUQ pain, strongly suggest a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis or a gallstone causing obstruction. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis.

Action: physical examination
Action Input: Murphy's sign, Abdominal tenderness

ToolMessage:
"On admission:  Vitals: Temp 97, HR 96, BP 157/94, RR 14, SpO2 100% RA GEN: A&O, NAD, shifted position multiple times due to pain HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist, PERRL CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R, resonant to  percussion bilaterally ABD: Soft, distended. TTP in RUQ without rebound or guarding.  Negative ___ sign. Normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses. Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused, 3+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination results show tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) without rebound or guarding, and a negative Murphy's sign. The absence of a positive Murphy's sign does not rule out acute cholecystitis, as it can be negative in some cases. The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging studies are consistent with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis or a gallstone causing obstruction.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute cholecystitis
2. Gallstone causing obstruction
3. Biliary colic
4. Pancreatitis
5. Peptic ulcer disease
Treatment: The patient should be admitted to the hospital for further management. The treatment plan should include:
* Intravenous fluids for hydration
* Pain management with analgesics
* Antibiotics to cover for possible infection
* Bowel rest to reduce gallbladder stimulation
* Surgical consultation for possible cholecystectomy
* Monitoring of liver function tests and complete blood count to assess for any complications
* Consideration of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) if there is evidence of a common bile duct stone.
