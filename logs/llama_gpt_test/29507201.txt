Patient History:
___, no significant PMH, p/w RLQ pain. Patient reports pain  onset was 2 days ago. It was gradual in nature and progressively  worsening now 5 out of 10 ___ out of 10 with movement.  Associated with nausea no vomiting no fevers or chills no change  in bowel or bladder habits. No testicular pain. No new exercises  over the past week. No history of any abdominal surgeries.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain that started 2 days ago, gradual in onset, and worsening over time. The pain is exacerbated by movement and is associated with nausea. There are no fevers, chills, changes in bowel or bladder habits, or testicular pain. The patient has a past medical history of Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and Anxiety. Given the location and nature of the pain, differential diagnoses could include appendicitis, ovarian cyst or torsion (if female), intestinal obstruction, or other abdominal pathologies. To further evaluate the patient, laboratory tests and imaging studies would be helpful.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count (12.0 K/uL) with a neutrophil predominance, which could indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The basic metabolic panel is largely unremarkable, with normal electrolyte levels and renal function. The urinalysis shows a specific gravity of 1.015, which is within normal limits, and minimal proteinuria (30.0 mg/dL). There are few bacteria and rare mucous in the urine, but no nitrites or leukocytes, making a urinary tract infection less likely. The absence of ESR and CRP results limits the ability to fully assess the inflammatory response. Given the clinical presentation of RLQ pain and the laboratory findings, further evaluation with imaging is necessary to narrow down the differential diagnoses.

"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Ultrasound,\" is not available in the provided list of imaging studies.   However, the requested \"Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan\" matches the available imaging study \"CTU (ABD/PEL) W/CONTRAST (CTU).\" Here is the full report for the CTU:  **CTU (ABD/PEL) W/CONTRAST (CTU):**  **EXAMINATION:** CTU with contrast  **TECHNIQUE:** CTU: Multidetector CT of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired prior to and after intravenous contrast administration with the patient in prone position. The non-contrast scan was done with low radiation dose technique. The contrast scan was performed with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Total DLP (Body) = 542 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There are 2 hypodensities in segment IV of the liver with subtle peripheral enhancement, largest of which measures 1.2 x 1.2 cm which statistically represent hemangiomas given patient's age. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis. There is no hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions. There is no evidence of urothelial lesions. The distal ureters and bladder are unremarkable.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The ascending colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is abnormally dilated inflamed, with an appendicular with at the base, and dilated with stranding suggestive of micro perforation. The adjacent cecum and ileum are thickened and inflamed. There is no evidence of surrounding fluid collections.  **PELVIS:** There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."
