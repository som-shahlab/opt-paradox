HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with a h/o DM2, HTN and asthma who presents  with a three day history of RLQ abdominal pain. This pain first  started when she was going on a walk. She had to go home and lay  down as the pain was so severe. The pain has progressed and is  now a ___ LRQ pain, described as sharp and non-radiating. She  does not feel that this pain is worsened by eating, and the only  thing that alleviates the pain is lying still. She notes  accompanying nausea, diminished appetite and night sweats,  however she denies vomitting, recent GI illness or changes to  bowel habits.  The patient has never had anything like this before. She does  not report any prior abdominal surgery or GI diseases. Her LMP  was ___, and she has no known prior history of STI. She  does not believe she could be pregant.  ROS was otherwise negative: no BRBPR, melena, vomitting, vaginal  discharge, dysuria or abdominal trauma.   Past Medical History: - asthma treated with albuterol inhaler PRN - DM2: diagnosed ___ years ago, but pt stopped taking  medications to 'manage this disease naturally' - HTN: unknown date of diagnosis, does not take recommended medications - obesity - G3P0: pt has three prior pregnancies, all of which have ended in miscarriage  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: - R knee surgery - denies prior abdominal surgery   Social History: ___ Family History: Significant for brain anyurysms (mother, ___, m uncle),  CAD, DM. Mother has ___.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a three-day history of abdominal pain that started in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and has progressed to the left lower quadrant (LLQ). The pain is sharp, non-radiating, and alleviated by lying still. Accompanying symptoms include nausea, diminished appetite, and night sweats. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), and asthma. She has not been taking her recommended medications for DM2 and HTN. The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a possible gastrointestinal or renal issue. However, the absence of vomiting, recent GI illness, changes to bowel habits, and prior abdominal surgery or GI diseases makes it essential to consider other potential causes.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a relatively normal complete blood count (CBC), basic metabolic panel (BMP), and urinalysis. However, the absence of lipase and amylase results makes it difficult to rule out pancreatic issues. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and diminished appetite could be indicative of a gastrointestinal issue, but the normal laboratory results do not provide a clear diagnosis. Further testing is needed to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal CT Scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT Scan,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT-acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness. Intravenous contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were prepared.  **CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:** The lung bases are clear. No focal pulmonary nodule or mass is identified. There is no pleural effusion. The imaged cardiac apex is within normal limits. The liver demonstrates homogeneous parenchymal enhancement without suspicious focal lesion. The hepatic veins and portal venous system are grossly patent. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal. There is symmetric enhancement and excretion of both kidneys without suspicious focal lesion or hydronephrosis. The abdominal aorta and its branch vessels are non-aneurysmal and grossly patent. There is no abdominal free fluid or free air. The stomach and small bowel loops are normal in caliber and configuration without evidence of obstruction or inflammation. The appendix is prominent measuring up to 6 mm in maximum diameter. The tip is ill-defined and has some mild surrounding fat stranding and fascial thickening. Findings are equivocal for early acute tip ____.  **CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:** The rectum and colon are normal in caliber and configuration without evidence of obstruction or inflammation. There is a moderate amount of stool within the cecum and ascending colon. The uterus and adnexa appear within normal limits on this CT examination. No large adnexal mass lesion is identified. There is no appreciable pelvic free fluid. The bladder is moderately distended and appears normal.  **OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:** No bone destructive lesion or acute fracture is identified."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan results show a prominent appendix with a maximum diameter of 6 mm, an ill-defined tip, and mild surrounding fat stranding and fascial thickening. These findings are equivocal for early acute appendicitis. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and diminished appetite could be consistent with appendicitis. However, the absence of definitive findings on the CT scan and the patient's medical history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma make it essential to consider other potential causes.

ToolMessage:

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination results show exquisite tenderness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), rebound tenderness, and involuntary guarding, which are consistent with appendicitis. The positive psoas sign also supports this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, combined with the CT scan results, suggest that appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Diverticulitis
4. Intestinal obstruction
5. Pancreatitis
Treatment: The patient should undergo an urgent appendectomy to remove the inflamed appendix. Antibiotics should be administered pre-operatively to reduce the risk of infection. Post-operative care should include pain management, wound care, and monitoring for complications. The patient's diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and asthma should be managed concurrently with the treatment of appendicitis.
