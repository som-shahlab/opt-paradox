Patient History:
___ male with a prior history colectomy ___ colonic  polyp disease with illeo-sigmoid anastomosis c.b anastomotic  stricture s/p dilation in ___, hypothyroidism and distant  history of hodgkins lymphoma s/p chemo/radiation who presents  for abdominal pain, jaundice, dark red urine.    Patient reports that he has been feeling Patient states that on  ___ he became "backed" up. ___ he notes passing  several bouts of first firm and then diarrhea stools. Patient  endorses one bout of emesis on night PTA. Patient denies f/c. He  does endorse abdominal pain since ___ days ago that is worse in  the RUQ.    Wife had been out of town for 2 days and when she returned  today she noticed that patient was jaundiced, for which he  presented to OSH ED. No melena, hematechezia, or hematemesis. No  CP, SOB, palpitations. No easy bruising or bleeding. At OSH ED  he had a CT scan (see below) and was found to have a t.bili of  18, so he was transferred to ___ ED for further management.    Of note, patient has had jaundice in the past with elevated  T.bili in the setting of hospitalization with a negative liver  workup. Per review of our records he has had a prominent  indirect component in the past.    In the ED, initial vitals were:    99.0 86 135/65 18 98% RA     Past Medical History: PMH: Hodkin's lymphoma, hypothyroidism, nephrolithiasis  PSH: Open splenectomy (___), Right colectomy for Polyps in ___, Total Abdominal Colectomy with ileosigmoid anastomosis ___ for additional polyps    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother is alive at ___ - just moved to ___ and has DM.  Father  died of an MI at age ___. He also had DM


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, jaundice, and dark red urine, which suggests a possible liver or biliary tract issue. The patient's history of colectomy, colonic polyp disease, and anastomotic stricture, as well as his previous episodes of jaundice with elevated total bilirubin, are relevant to his current presentation. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including a total bilirubin of 18, indicate a need for further evaluation.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes, including ALT and AST, as well as an elevated total bilirubin level with a prominent indirect component. The patient's complete blood count shows a mild anemia and thrombocytopenia. The electrolyte panel is relatively normal. The patient's lipase level is within normal limits. These results suggest a possible liver or biliary tract issue, and the patient's history of jaundice and elevated total bilirubin in the past is relevant to his current presentation.

Action: Consultation with a specialist, such as a gastroenterologist or hepatologist, to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition.

However, I will provide the final diagnosis and treatment plan as per the format.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Cholecystitis or gallstone disease
2. Hepatobiliary dysfunction
3. Anemia
4. Thrombocytopenia
5. Hypothyroidism

Treatment: The patient should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management. The treatment plan should include:
- Intravenous fluids and pain management
- Antibiotics to cover for possible infection
- Ultrasound-guided gallbladder drainage or cholecystectomy if indicated
- Consultation with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition
- Monitoring of liver function tests and complete blood count
- Management of anemia and thrombocytopenia as needed
- Management of hypothyroidism as needed

Note: The treatment plan should be individualized based on the patient's specific needs and medical history.
