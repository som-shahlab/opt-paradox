Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, vomiting, and a history of recent proctectomy and end colostomy for adenocarcinoma. The pain is described as sharp, constant, and diffuse, but worse in the epigastric region. Given the patient's complex medical history, including hypercholesterolemia, hip fracture, post-operative DVT, and mild CHF, it is essential to consider multiple potential causes for the abdominal pain, including bowel obstruction, infection, or thromboembolic events. The patient's use of coumadin also increases the risk of bleeding complications.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The basic metabolic panel and liver function tests are relatively normal, but the coagulation studies show an INR of 0.9, which is slightly below the normal range, potentially indicating a risk of thrombosis. The lipase and amylase levels are within normal limits, making pancreatitis less likely. Given the patient's complex medical history and the presence of a murmur, mild CHF, and a history of DVT, it is essential to consider cardiovascular causes of abdominal pain, such as mesenteric ischemia or embolism.

"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT): TECHNIQUE: Helical CT acquisition from lung bases to pubic symphysis after administration of intravenous and oral contrast. Multiplanar reformations were generated. CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The imaged lung bases demonstrate atelectasis. There is a large, proximal stomach-containing hiatal hernia. Tortuous aortic contour is noted with aortic calcifications. There is trace pericardial effusion. Mild periportal edema is present. The gallbladder is distended with a stone present in the gallbladder neck. There is mild gallbladder wall edema and pericholecystic fluid. CBD is dilated measuring up to 1.3 cm, slightly larger than the prior measurement of 1.2 cm. The pancreatic duct also measures at the upper limits of normal, measuring 3 mm. Although no focal pancreatic masses or lesions were identified, distal small CBD stone cannot be excluded, and this may be further evaluated either with ultrasound or MRCP. The spleen, bilateral adrenals are unremarkable. There are bilateral low-attenuation renal lesions, the largest in the inferior pole of right kidney measuring 3.4 x 3.1 cm is suggestive of a simple cyst, others are too small to characterize. There are multiple retroperitoneal nodes that are not enlarged by CT criteria, the largest is seen at the aortocaval junction, measuring up to 8 mm in short axis. There is a vena caval filter. There is a large ventral abdominal hernia containing non-obstructed loops of both small bowel and colon. There is a left lower quadrant colostomy with a small parastomal hernia. There is no free fluid or free air. CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The evaluation of the pelvis is limited due to streak artifact from the right hip hemiarthroplasty. There is a right adnexal cyst measuring 2.3 x 2.6 cm; The left ovary also contains a 1.8 x 1.3 cm cystic structure; given age, further evaluation with a non-emergent ultrasound is recommended. There is no free fluid. The patient is status post sigmoid colectomy given history of colon cancer. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There has been interval left hip hemiarthroplasty with an old left proximal femoral fracture. Loss of height at L4 is unchanged since the prior. There are no suspicious osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesions."

AIMessage:
Thought: The abdominal CT with contrast shows a large, proximal stomach-containing hiatal hernia, tortuous aortic contour with aortic calcifications, trace pericardial effusion, mild periportal edema, a distended gallbladder with a stone, and a slightly dilated common bile duct (CBD). The pancreatic duct is at the upper limits of normal. There are bilateral low-attenuation renal lesions, multiple small retroperitoneal nodes, a vena caval filter, a large ventral abdominal hernia, and a left lower quadrant colostomy with a small parastomal hernia. The CT pelvis shows a right adnexal cyst and a left ovary cystic structure. Given the patient's complex medical history and the presence of a murmur, mild CHF, and a history of DVT, it is essential to consider cardiovascular causes of abdominal pain, such as mesenteric ischemia or embolism. The presence of aortic calcifications and a tortuous aortic contour may increase the risk of embolic events.
