Patient History:
Ms. ___ presents with 7 days of cramping abdominal pain localized to the RUQ and nausea and emesis that started 3 days ago. Ms. ___ awakened in the middle of the night on ___ with bilateral cramping abdominal pain in the hypogastrium, nausea, and nonbloody, non-bilious emesis. Over the subsequent  24 hours the pain localized to the RUQ, was constant, and was cramping in quality.This pain lasted only ___ hours per episode, however she had multiple episodes since last ___. However today the pain worsen and lasted longer then 4 hrs, hence she presented to the ED.She also complained of decreased appetite. She endorses chills without fever and ongoing  watery diarrhea, which not unusual for her. She denies syncope, SOB, CP sick contacts, dysuria, constipation, or weight changes. .    Past Medical History: PMH: Diverticulosis Uterine fibroids DM Bipolar Liver cyst HTN Dyslipidemia . PSH: Laparoscopic tubal ligation    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother - DM, still alive at ___+ years of age .


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a 7-day history of cramping abdominal pain localized to the right upper quadrant (RUQ), accompanied by nausea, emesis, and decreased appetite. The pain initially started as bilateral cramping abdominal pain in the hypogastrium but localized to the RUQ over time. The patient also reports chills without fever, ongoing watery diarrhea, and a history of diverticulosis, uterine fibroids, diabetes mellitus (DM), bipolar disorder, liver cyst, hypertension (HTN), and dyslipidemia. Given the patient's symptoms and medical history, it is essential to consider various differential diagnoses, including gallbladder disease, peptic ulcer disease, and diverticulitis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.1 K/uL, indicating a potential infection or inflammatory process. The liver function tests (LFTs) are relatively normal, with slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. The lipase level is within normal limits, which makes pancreatitis less likely. The urinalysis shows the presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, and protein, suggesting a possible urinary tract infection or kidney stone. However, the patient's symptoms and history are more suggestive of a gastrointestinal issue.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ) Ultrasound, Gallbladder Ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Right Upper Quadrant (RUQ) Ultrasound,\" matches the available imaging study \"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound).\" Here is the full report:  **EXAM:** Right upper quadrant ultrasound.  **FINDINGS:** The liver demonstrates normal, homogeneous echotexture without focal intrahepatic lesion seen. There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The gallbladder is not overly distended; however, evidence of cholelithiasis and sludge is seen. There is mild gallbladder wall thickening. No pericholecystic fluid is seen. Sonographic ___ sign is negative; however, the question is raised if patient is diabetic. Main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The common bile duct is normal in caliber measuring 0.3 cm in diameter. The pancreas is partially obscured by overlying bowel gas, although the visualized portion is unremarkable, without pancreatic ductal dilatation."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's right upper quadrant (RUQ) ultrasound shows evidence of cholelithiasis (gallstones) and sludge in the gallbladder, as well as mild gallbladder wall thickening. These findings are consistent with cholecystitis, which is an inflammation of the gallbladder. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are also consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of gallstones and sludge in the gallbladder increases the risk of gallbladder inflammation and infection.

Extremities: Warm, well-perfused, 2+ pulses. No c/c/e. Neuro: Motor function grossly intact"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination reveals tenderness to deep palpation in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) of the abdomen, which is consistent with the diagnosis of cholecystitis. The presence of bowel sounds and the absence of rebound tenderness suggest that the patient does not have a perforated viscus or peritonitis. The patient's vital signs are stable, but the heart rate is slightly elevated, which may indicate pain or inflammation.

Action: None, proceeding to diagnosis and treatment.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Cholecystitis
2. Gallstone disease
3. Peptic ulcer disease
4. Diverticulitis
5. Pancreatitis
Treatment: The patient should be admitted to the hospital for further management and treatment. The treatment plan should include:
* Intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration
* Pain management with analgesics
* Antibiotics to treat any potential infection
* Bowel rest to reduce gallbladder stimulation
* Surgical consultation for potential cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal)
* Monitoring of liver function tests and complete blood count to assess for any complications
* Follow-up imaging studies to assess the gallbladder and biliary system.
