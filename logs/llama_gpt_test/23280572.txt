HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with several hours of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea,  vomiting, diarrhea and anorexia. Initially thought she had the  stomach flu because her boyfriend had similar symptoms. However  her pain progressed so she presented to the ED. No recent  travel. She is a college senior.    Past Medical History: PMH: none   PSH: none     Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia, which could be indicative of a gastrointestinal issue. The initial thought of stomach flu due to similar symptoms in her boyfriend is plausible, but the progression of her pain warrants further investigation. Given her age and lack of past medical history, it's essential to consider common causes of abdominal pain in young adults, such as appendicitis, gastroenteritis, or other inflammatory conditions.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal Tenderness, Rebound Tenderness, McBurney's Point Tenderness, Bowel Sounds

"Admission   Vitals:98  89  116/71  16  99 RA GEN: A&Ox3, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR PULM: no respiratory distress ABD: Soft, nondistended, TTP in the RLQ, no rebound or guarding Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination reveals tenderness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) of the abdomen, which is a common location for appendicitis. The absence of rebound tenderness or guarding suggests that the condition may not be severe, but the presence of RLQ tenderness warrants further investigation. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, laboratory tests and imaging studies can help confirm the diagnosis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a high white blood cell count (15.6 K/uL) with a predominance of neutrophils (79.5%), indicating a possible bacterial infection. The urinalysis results are relatively unremarkable, with only a few bacteria and rare mucous, which may not be significant. The liver function tests are within normal limits. The lipase level is slightly elevated (33.0 IU/L), but not significantly so. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, an imaging study such as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis may help confirm the diagnosis.
