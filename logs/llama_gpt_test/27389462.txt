___ gentleman with a history of stage II clear-cell  renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in ___ s/p right nephrectomy c/b  metastatic pleural nodules and malignant effusion on a trial at  this time (on Axitinib/Dalantercept vs. Axitinib/placebo, chem  ___ presenting with abdominal pain that started on ___  after eating a fatty meal on ___. It now radiates to back. No  associated n/v or diharea or fever but has had decreased  appetitie. Pain comes and goes. No dyuria, moving bowel and  passing gas. Today had some SOB which he attributes to pain and  no eating. No CP.   In the ED, initial vitals were: 98.0 67 112/61 18 100% RA.     Exam notable for: none recorded     Labs notable for: 130/4.___/1.9 ALT 143 AST 334 AP 499 Tbili 5.4  Lipase 1494   Imaging was notable for:  Abdominal ultrasound: 1. There are stones and sludge in a mildly distended gallbladder  with walledema, measuring up to 1 cm and positive sonographic  ___ sign. Findings are concerning for cholecystitis. 2. The pancreas is not well visualized due to overlying bowel  gas.   Patient was given:  IVF  NS ( 1000 mL ordered)  IVF  LR ( 1000 mL ordered)   IV Morphine Sulfate 4 mg    IV Ondansetron 4 mg   IV HYDROmorphone (Dilaudid) .5 mg ceftriaxone ordered (not given) Surgery was consulted.       Upon arrival to the floor, patient reports that he is feeling  much improved, pain is a t 1%.  He states that he had had not  been passing gas yesterday but is today.  He had some dysuria  yesterday but that has now resolved. No nausea or vomiting. No  chest pain or SOB.     REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   (+) Per HPI   (-) 10 point ROS reviewed and negative unless stated above in  HPI      Past Medical History: Oncologic: stage II clear-cell renal cell carcinoma diagnosed in  ___ s/p right nephrectomy, then with metastatic pleural nodules and malignant effusion in ___, started on pazopanib ___ but with recent disease progression, stopped his Pazopanib on ___, started ___ of axitinib +/- dalantercept, a novel ALK  - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - MI in ___, did not require stents or surgery - CHF, reportedly last EF 55% - A.flutter (had been on warfarin for 5 months in the past) - Thyroid nodules - GERD - Colonic polyps inhibitor on ___.     Social History: ___ Family History: His mother had ovarian cancer. One of his brothers died of liver cancer. Another brother had ESRD, was on HD, and died of complications.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain that radiates to the back, which started after eating a fatty meal. The pain is intermittent and has decreased in severity since arrival to the floor. The patient has a history of stage II clear-cell renal cell carcinoma with metastatic pleural nodules and malignant effusion, and is currently on a trial of Axitinib/Dalantercept vs. Axitinib/placebo. The patient's laboratory values show elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, AP) and lipase, which suggests a possible diagnosis of pancreatitis or cholecystitis. The abdominal ultrasound findings of stones and sludge in the gallbladder with wall edema and a positive sonographic Murphy's sign are concerning for cholecystitis.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging studies, CT Abdomen with IV contrast and MRI Gallbladder, are not available in the provided list of imaging studies."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory values and abdominal ultrasound findings suggest a possible diagnosis of cholecystitis or pancreatitis. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and radiation to the back are consistent with these diagnoses. The patient's history of cancer and current treatment with Axitinib/Dalantercept vs. Axitinib/placebo may also be relevant to the diagnosis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cholecystitis, with mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) of the abdomen. The patient's laboratory values and abdominal ultrasound findings also support this diagnosis. The patient's history of cancer and current treatment with Axitinib/Dalantercept vs. Axitinib/placebo may increase the risk of complications from cholecystitis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory values and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cholecystitis. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and neutrophilia suggest an infectious or inflammatory process. The patient's electrolyte panel shows a mild hyponatremia, but otherwise the values are within normal limits.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination findings and laboratory values are consistent with a diagnosis of cholecystitis. The patient's symptoms and signs have improved with treatment, but it is essential to consider the potential complications of cholecystitis, such as perforation or gangrene. The patient's history of cancer and current treatment with Axitinib/Dalantercept vs. Axitinib/placebo may increase the risk of complications.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Cholecystitis
2. Pancreatitis
3. Peptic ulcer disease
4. Hepatitis
5. Biliary obstruction

Treatment: The patient should be treated with antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, and pain management, such as morphine or hydrocodone. The patient should also be monitored for signs of complications, such as perforation or gangrene, and undergo surgical evaluation for potential cholecystectomy. Additionally, the patient's cancer treatment should be continued, and the patient should be monitored for signs of disease progression or treatment-related side effects.
