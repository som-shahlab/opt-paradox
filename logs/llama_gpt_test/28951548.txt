HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ yo male s/p RNY gastric bypass ___ with a  remote history of a marginal ulcer who was in his usual state of   health until he awoke from sleep with severe abdominal pain and  subsequently presented to an OSH on ___.  Upon  arrival to ___ he was placed on bowel rest, given  intravenous fluids and underwent CT scan, which suggested some  stranding of mesenteric fat in close proximity to the  gastrojejunal anastomosis.  The patient was then transferred to  ___ and admitted to the ___ surgery service for further  evaluation and monitoring.   Overnight on HD1, the patient vomited contrast from the CT  obtained at the OSH and reported complete resolution of his  symptoms.  His diet was advanced the following day to a  bariatric stage II which he initially tolerated without pain,  nausea or vomiting.  Given that he remained hemodynamically  stable and had tolerated oral intake, he was discharged.   However, just prior leaving the hospital, Mr. ___ vomited a  small amount of broth, which he attributed to the taste and  reported feeling well overall.  It was reviewed with the patient   that the second read for the OSH CT was still pending and if he  wished to leave, he must return to the hospital immediately if  he were to experience any recurrence of his symptoms.  On his way home developed severe vomiting and returned to the  hospital where he was re-admitted.   Past Medical History: Hypertension Hyperlipidemia Hypothyroidism Peripheral neuropathy Kidney stones Papillary urethral cancer Marginal ulcer s/p Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ___ s/p thyroidectomy s/p R ACL repair   Social History: ___ Family History: Father: deceased, CAD Mother: deceased, COPD Brother: MI, cerebral palsy


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and presented with severe abdominal pain, which suggested some stranding of mesenteric fat in close proximity to the gastrojejunal anastomosis on CT scan. The patient's symptoms initially resolved, but then recurred with severe vomiting after discharge. Given the patient's complex medical history and the recurrence of symptoms, further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the abdominal pain and vomiting.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results are largely within normal limits, with no significant elevations in amylase or lipase to suggest pancreatitis, and no significant abnormalities in the complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, or liver function tests. Given the patient's history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and the recurrence of symptoms, further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the abdominal pain and vomiting.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, Upper GI Series, is not available in the provided list of imaging studies."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results are largely within normal limits, and the Upper GI Series was not available. Given the patient's history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and the recurrence of symptoms, further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the abdominal pain and vomiting. An abdominal X-ray or CT scan with oral contrast may help to identify any potential issues with the gastrojejunal anastomosis or other abdominal structures.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"CT scan with oral contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. IV Contrast: 130 mL Omnipaque. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. Oral contrast was administered. DOSE: 847 mGy-cm. D LP  **FINDINGS:** Status post Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. There is interval decreased distention of the proximal stomach; however, it remains larger than expected for post bypass status. There is oral contrast traversing through the gastrojejunal anastomosis, and into the small bowel. Persistent fat stranding is appreciated surrounding the gastric jejunal anastomosis, with associated prominent regional reactive lymph nodes, maximally measuring up to 1.1 cm in short axis (02:28). No oral contrast is seen entering the excluded stomach or biliary limb. No obstruction appreciated in the current study. The remainder of the alimentary tract is unchanged in appearance, including scattered colonic diverticulosis. Normal appendix in the right lower quadrant. No free air or free fluid. Other findings within the abdomen are unchanged including mildly distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis, likely secondary to fasting state. Atrophic right kidney, with mild hydronephrosis and hydroureter up to the anastomosis within the right anterior bladder. Slightly delayed right nephrogram. Multiple right anterior bladder diverticuli. Right renal cyst. Multiple small retroperitoneal and para-aortic lymph nodes, without pathologic enlargement. Small left pleural effusion with associated subsegmental atelectasis, new from previous.  **NOTIFICATION:** Findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ telephone at 08:45am."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan with oral contrast shows that there is persistent fat stranding surrounding the gastric jejunal anastomosis, with associated prominent regional reactive lymph nodes. This suggests that there may be an issue with the anastomosis, such as a leak or stricture. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and vomiting are consistent with this finding. Given the patient's history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and the imaging findings, a diagnosis of gastrojejunal anastomotic leak or stricture should be considered.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination shows mild tenderness to palpation in the abdomen, but no rebound or guarding. The incisions are clean and dry, and there is no erythema or induration. The patient's vital signs are stable. Given the patient's history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, the imaging findings of persistent fat stranding surrounding the gastric jejunal anastomosis, and the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and vomiting, a diagnosis of gastrojejunal anastomotic leak or stricture is likely.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Gastrojejunal anastomotic leak
2. Gastrojejunal anastomotic stricture
3. Marginal ulcer
4. Intestinal obstruction
5. Intra-abdominal abscess
Treatment: The patient should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and bowel rest. A gastrografin study or upper GI series should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of gastrojejunal anastomotic leak. If a leak is confirmed, the patient may require surgical intervention to repair the leak. If a stricture is diagnosed, the patient may require endoscopic dilation or surgical intervention to repair the stricture. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis or peritonitis, and should be treated promptly if these conditions develop.
