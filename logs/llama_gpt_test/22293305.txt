HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/ history of ulcerative colitis (without significant flare  ups in past ___ years) presenting today with nausea, vomiting  since 7 pm last night and now RLQ pain. Nausea and vomiting  initially started last night, which he at first ignored but  symptoms persisted. Around midnight he started noticing some  pain in the mid abdomen which he attributed to the vomiting. The pain  gradually intensified and localized to the RLQ. Felt some  subjective fevers, chills. Denies diarrhea, hematochezia, blood  in stools.  . He does not currently take any steroids for his UC. He was first  diagnosed around the age of ___ on colonoscopy (he was then told  left sided UC) and was on prednisone, Asacol and Rowasa. He  weaned off the prednisone and Rowasa, currently only takes  Asacol and states that he has not had any significant flare ups  in at least ___ years. When he gets attacks, he usually complains  of diarrhea, bowel frequency and urgency, occasional blood in  stools and weight loss. He is being followed by Dr. ___  ___ ___.   Past Medical History: Past Medical History: ulcerative colitis as above, ADD,  childhood asthma and mild seasonal allergies, osteopenia treated with bisphosphonates for ___ years, lactose intolerance . Past Surgical History: denies    Social History: ___ Family History: Father with diabetes and obesity. Grandfather with GI symptoms,  unclear what. No hx of colon cancer or other GI dz.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) and is presenting with nausea, vomiting, and right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, which are not typical symptoms of a UC flare-up. The patient's symptoms, including subjective fevers and chills, suggest a possible infectious or inflammatory process. Given the patient's history of UC, it is possible that the patient may be experiencing a complication related to UC, such as a bowel obstruction or toxic megacolon, although the absence of diarrhea and hematochezia makes this less likely. Alternatively, the patient's symptoms could be related to a separate condition, such as appendicitis or a gastrointestinal infection.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a elevated white blood cell count (16.1 K/uL) with a predominance of neutrophils (93.7%), which suggests a possible bacterial infection or inflammatory process. The patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit are within normal limits, which makes anemia less likely. The liver function tests are within normal limits, which suggests that the patient does not have significant liver dysfunction. The patient's electrolytes and renal function are also within normal limits.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan with contrast

ToolMessage:
"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT): TECHNIQUE: MDCT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast. Images were displayed in multiple planes. FINDINGS: ABDOMEN: The liver enhances homogeneously with no focal lesions. The main portal vein is patent. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is mildly prominent with no wall thickening or filling defects. The pancreas enhances homogeneously. Spleen is normal. A 15 x 14 left adrenal nodule is incompletely assessed. The right adrenal gland has normal contour and appearance. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly. The stomach and small bowel have normal caliber, appearance. PELVIS: The appendix is abnormally dilated with a proximal diameter of 14 mm. The appendiceal tip tapers to a diameter of 10 mm. There is extensive wall enhancement and surrounding fluid and phlegmonous change. The adjacent lateral conal fascia is thickened. There is a small periappendiceal fluid collection seen on series 2, image 50 measuring approximately 2.1 x 2.8 x 2.4 cm. Multiple small lymph nodes are seen in the RLQ, likely reactive. A small amount of free fluid is seen in the pelvis (2:29). Remainder of the large bowel has normal caliber and appearance. There is no pelvic or inguinal adenopathy. BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions are appreciated."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's abdominal CT scan with contrast shows an abnormally dilated appendix with wall enhancement and surrounding fluid and phlegmonous change, which is consistent with acute appendicitis. The presence of a small periappendiceal fluid collection and thickened lateral conal fascia also supports this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and right lower quadrant pain are also consistent with acute appendicitis.
