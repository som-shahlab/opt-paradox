He has had darker urine but no light colored stools. + subjective fevers resolved with Tylenol. No objective fevers or shaking chills. He had two episodes of emesis yesterday. He has lost 5lbs. He has had anoxrexia and decreased appetite. He does not report chest pain, shortness of breath, back pain, neuro sx or focal weakness.   He flew back from ___ yesterday and then went to his PCP today  who referred him to ___.  There he was found to have a lipase of 1069 and elevated WBC.  Upon arrival to the ED VS: Pain = ___, T = 98.7, HR = 82, BP = 142/76, O2sat = 98% on RA,  Na = 129, K= 4.6, Cr = 1.1, BS = 99 Lipase = 252 WBC = 17.0 with 85% PMNS.   Past Medical History:  TA grade  TCC of the bladder treated with BCG infusions-  - Renal cancer s/p R nephrectomy- Clear cell, renal cell carcinoma, 3.9-cm, G3, pT3a, margins negative - HTN - ?

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with worsening diffuse epigastric pain, diarrhea, gas, and flatulence, along with a history of pancreatic cancer, splenic vein thrombus, and recent travel. The patient's laboratory results show elevated lipase and WBC, indicating possible pancreatitis. However, the patient's complex medical history, including kidney cancer, TCC of the bladder, and pancreatic cancer, requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.

Remainder the liver is unremarkable with no biliary ductal dilatation. Gallbladder is unremarkable.   **PANCREAS:** Pancreatic divisum present. There is re-demonstration of a 1.4 cm hypoenhancing lesion with a probable cystic central component at the pancreatic neck with associated upstream mild dilatation of the pancreatic duct measuring up to 0.4 mm. The radiologic appearance is in keeping with the histologic diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma. There has been interval development moderate amount peripancreatic fluid tracking along the stomach. The pancreas itself does not demonstrate enlargement and remains enhancing. Findings are consistent with acute interstitial ____. There is an intramural loculated collection along the lesser curvature of the stomach measuring up to 3.3 cm.   **SPLEEN:** No splenomegaly.   **ADRENALS:** Unremarkable.   **URINARY:** Post right nephrectomy. There is a left interpolar renal cortical hypodensity likely a cyst. There is no hydronephrosis on the left.   **GASTROINTESTINAL:** Inflammatory changes extend along the greater and lesser curvatures of the stomach. There is no bowel obstruction. There are scattered colonic diverticulosis without diverticulitis.   **PERITONEUM:** There is small amount of free intraperitoneal air tracking from the pancreatic region.   **LYMPH NODES:** There is no adenopathy.   **VASCULAR:** Abdominal aorta is normal in caliber with patent intra-abdominal branches. There are no acute vascular occlusions are pseudoaneurysms. There is severe attenuation of the portal vein at its confluence with patent SMV, splenic vein and main portal vein.   **PELVIS:** Urinary bladder demonstrates a small bladder diverticulum along the posterolateral aspect on the right.   **BONES:** There are multilevel degenerative changes of the lower thoracic upper lumbar spine with no acute osseous abnormalities or suspicious osseous lesions.   **SOFT TISSUES:** Soft tissues are unremarkable."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a 1.4 cm hypoenhancing lesion at the pancreatic neck with associated upstream mild dilatation of the pancreatic duct, consistent with the histologic diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma. The scan also shows moderate amount of peripancreatic fluid, an intramural loculated collection along the lesser curvature of the stomach, and small amount of free intraperitoneal air tracking from the pancreatic region. The patient's lipase and WBC are elevated, indicating possible pancreatitis. The patient's complex medical history, including kidney cancer, TCC of the bladder, and pancreatic cancer, requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's amylase is elevated, which is consistent with pancreatitis. The patient's electrolyte panel shows a low sodium level, which may be due to various factors such as dehydration, pancreatitis, or other underlying conditions. The liver function tests are relatively normal, but the coagulation studies show a slightly elevated INR, which may be due to the patient's anticoagulation therapy with lovenox. The patient's complex medical history, including kidney cancer, TCC of the bladder, and pancreatic cancer, requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination shows abdominal tenderness, diminished bowel sounds, and diffuse ecchymoses at the site of lovenox injections. The patient's vital signs are stable, and the patient is alert and oriented. The patient's complex medical history, including kidney cancer, TCC of the bladder, and pancreatic cancer, requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause of his symptoms.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Pancreatitis
2. Pancreatic cancer
3. Sepsis
4. Deep vein thrombosis
5. Acute kidney injury

Treatment: The patient should be treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation, pain management, and nutritional support. The patient's lovenox therapy should be continued, and the patient's INR should be closely monitored. The patient's pancreatic cancer should be evaluated for possible surgical or chemotherapeutic intervention. The patient's sepsis should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and the patient's deep vein thrombosis should be treated with anticoagulation therapy. The patient's acute kidney injury should be treated with supportive care and close monitoring of the patient's renal function. 

Note: The patient's treatment plan should be individualized based on the patient's specific needs and medical history. The patient's care should be coordinated by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals, including surgeons, oncologists, and internists.
