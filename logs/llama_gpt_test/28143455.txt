HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ p/w 35hrs of sudden-onset abdominal pain in the RLQ. Reports that since yesterday, he has had persistent RLQ pain, non-radiating, worse when standing and walking. No fevers at home, but does endorse chills, nausea and one episode of emesis in the ED. Prior to the onset of pain, he had diarrhea, which  has since resolved. He last ate at 4pm yesterday, and has been  taking advil for pain, last taken the night prior to admission.    Past Medical History: None. Some work-up performed for incidentally noted elevation in total bilirubin  PSH: None   Social History: ___ Family History: NC


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with sudden-onset abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is worsened by standing and walking. The presence of nausea, emesis, and chills suggests a possible infectious or inflammatory process. The patient's history of diarrhea prior to the onset of pain could be related to the current condition. The incidental elevation in total bilirubin may or may not be relevant to the current presentation. Given the acute onset of symptoms, further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the abdominal pain.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which could indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The liver function tests reveal a mild elevation in total bilirubin, which is consistent with the patient's past medical history. The lipase level is within normal limits, making acute pancreatitis less likely. However, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis suggest that further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the pain.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal CT scan with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. No oral contrast was administered.  **DOSE:** Total DLP (Body) = 497 mGy-cm. IV Contrast: 130 mL Omnipaque  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Lung bases are clear.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is unremarkable.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. No hydronephrosis.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness and enhancement throughout. Colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is slightly dilated in size to approximately 7 mm (previously 4 mm), with surrounding inflammatory stranding and mild hyperemia (601b:36, 602b:20). Findings are compatible with ____. No drainable fluid collection or free peritoneal air. There is no evidence of mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  **RETROPERITONEUM:** There is no evidence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is no calcium burden in the abdominal aorta and great abdominal arteries.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** Reproductive organs are within normal limits.  **BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions. Incidentally noted is left L5 spondylolysis (602b:42). Abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  **NOTIFICATION:** The above findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at 12:58 on ___."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan with contrast shows a slightly dilated appendix with surrounding inflammatory stranding and mild hyperemia, which is consistent with acute appendicitis. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis are also consistent with this diagnosis. Given the imaging findings and the patient's clinical presentation, acute appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis.
