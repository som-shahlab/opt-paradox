PVD including L CEA and left SFA angioplasty, sCHF ___  EF: 40%), Behcet's disease (on methotrexate) and Klebsiella and  Pseudomonas UTIs sensitive to ciprofloxacin who was transferred  to the ED from the ___ where she presented s/p fall found  to be febrile with an elevated WBC count. She had abdominal  tenderness at ___ which prompted a CT scan that showed  stable large hiatal hernia, b/l renal cysts, severe  atherosclerotic disease and a normal liver/gallbladder/pancreas.  She also had a CT c-spine that showed multiple thoracolumbar  compression fractures and a RUQ ultrasound that showed no e/o  cholecystitis. Notable labs at ___ include Lactate 2.8,  Lipase 530 and BNP 696. Surgery believed that she would need an  ERCP over the next ___ days and she was transferred to ___. Of  note, she is altered at baseline.   .   In the ED, initial VS: T 99.1 HR 98 BP 179/71 RR 18 O2 Sat 97%  2L   She was given 2L NS and received tylenol prior to transfer from  OSH. Labs were notable for WBC 12.4, ALT 49, AST 76, Liapse 77,  ALk Phos 121 and Trop 0.07. EKG was notable for Q waves in III  (unchanged from prior) and new decreased R wave progression  (likely lead placement) in the precordial leads and L atrial  enlargement. Otherwise, she was NSR, stable compared to prior.   On the floor, initial VS were:  THe patient states that she fell at home but does not remember  falling. SHe states that her son found her and told her that she  had fallen. She states that she went to ___ but  does not remember ever having abdomenal pain or chest pain. she  denies sob. She admits to pain (points to bladder) with  urination, and states that it hurts very much. She does not  recall how long this has been going on. She denies any other  pain or discomfort.   On speaking with her son, he states that for the past 2 weeks,  has had wheezing especially with exertion/climbing stairs.   Today at 3AM, came out of bathroom and fell, back hurting and  confused.  At baseline, has short/long term memory problems, not  generally confused unless she has a UTI or infection.  Ankles  have been more swollen lately.  She had a recent UTI and  finished antibiotic ciprofloxacin for 3 days then nitrofurantoin  7 days just finished ___.  7 days ago, had episode of  garbled speech (lasted several hours) and called PCP, didn't get  PCP ___ back, did not take her to ED, by the next  morning she improved.  She denies chest pain per the son.  No  abdominal pain.  No melena/hematochezia.  No cough.  At ___  was febril 102 rectally. .   ROS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision  changes, rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness  of breath, chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,  diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria,  hematuria.   .     Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   1. CARDIAC RISK FACTORS: -Diabetes, +Dyslipidemia, +Hypertension    2. CARDIAC HISTORY:   -CABG: History of 3-vessel CABG in ___ (SVG to LAD, SVG to  Diagonal, SVG to RCA).    -PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTIONS: bare metal stents placed  in ___ to LAD in ___ and SVG to RCA in ___,  3. OTHER PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  - Hypertension - L CEA ___ - PVD - esophageal stricture - Behcets disease - rectal prolapse  - hypothyroidism     Social History: ___ Family History: No family history of early MI, arrhythmia, cardiomyopathies, or  sudden cardiac death; otherwise non-contributory.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient is an elderly woman with a complex medical history, including hypertension, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and Behcet's disease. She was transferred to the ED after a fall and was found to be febrile with an elevated WBC count. The patient has a history of UTIs and was recently treated with ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible infection, and the elevated lactate and lipase levels may indicate pancreatic or abdominal pathology. However, the patient's altered mental status and lack of recall of abdominal or chest pain make it difficult to determine the exact cause of her symptoms.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a high WBC count, elevated lactate, and elevated BNP. The patient's troponin level is slightly elevated, but not significantly. The patient's EKG shows Q waves in III and decreased R wave progression, but the patient is in NSR. The patient's respiratory viral panel, blood cultures, and urine culture results are not available. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible infection, and the patient's elevated BNP and troponin level may indicate cardiac involvement.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Chest X-ray,\" is available. Here is the full report for the Chest X-ray:  **CHEST (PA & LAT) (Radiograph):**  **FINDINGS:** Again demonstrated is a very large hiatal hernia. Allowing for relatively low lung volumes, heart is upper limits of normal in size. Aorta is tortuous and diffusely calcified. Pulmonary vascularity is normal. Increased opacity is seen overlying the lower thoracic spine on the lateral radiograph, and likely corresponds to bilateral small pleural effusions and adjacent atelectasis. Compression deformity at thoracolumbar junction appears similar to recent thoracic spine radiograph of ___, and was more fully evaluated at that time."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's chest X-ray shows a large hiatal hernia, a tortuous and calcified aorta, and bilateral small pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis. The patient's echocardiogram results are not available. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible infection, and the patient's elevated BNP and troponin level may indicate cardiac involvement. The patient's imaging results show significant cardiovascular disease, including a large hiatal hernia and a tortuous and calcified aorta.
