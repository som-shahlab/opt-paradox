HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old female with hx of PCOS and asthma who presents with about 12 hours of acute, worsening mid-abdominal pain which is now mostly right lower quadrant  pain, also radiating to her back. She also endorses that with the worsening pain she developed nausea and vomited yellow material at about 11 pm last night. Due to the worsening pain she elected to present to the emergency room for evaluation. She notes that for the past few days she has been having some increasing constipation as well. She endorses some increased bloating over the past day. She denies recent travel, unusual foods, or sick contacts. She denies fevers, endorses chills. Denies changes in urinary habits. She denies shortness of breath of chest pain.   ROS: (+) per HPI (-) Denies night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue/malaise/lethargy, changes in appetite, trouble  with sleep, pruritis, jaundice, rashes, bleeding, easy bruising, headache, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, weakness, paresthesias, hematemesis, cramping, melena, BRBPR, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, edema, urinary frequency, urgency   Past Medical History: Past Medical History: PCOS, endometriosis, asthma, migraine headaches   PSH: R hip ___ ___ years ago, multiple laparoscopies for endometriosis (last at ___ ___ years ago)   Social History: ___ Family History: Mother died at age ___ of colon and pancreas cancer


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute, worsening mid-abdominal pain that has migrated to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and constipation. Her past medical history of PCOS, endometriosis, and multiple laparoscopies for endometriosis suggests a possible gynecological cause for her symptoms. However, the location and radiation of the pain, as well as the associated symptoms, also raise the possibility of an appendiceal or gastrointestinal issue. Given the complexity of her presentation, further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infectious or inflammatory process. The basic metabolic panel and liver function tests are largely within normal limits, although the urea nitrogen is slightly elevated, which could be indicative of dehydration or renal issues. The lipase level is within normal limits, making pancreatitis less likely. The urinalysis shows proteinuria and hematuria, which could be indicative of a renal or urinary tract issue. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging studies, Abdominal Ultrasound and Pelvic Ultrasound, are not available in the provided list. The available imaging study is a CT Abdomen and Pelvis with Contrast."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results and symptoms suggest a possible appendiceal or gastrointestinal issue, and the imaging study can help confirm the diagnosis. The CT Abdomen and Pelvis with Contrast can provide more detailed information about the patient's abdominal and pelvic organs, which can help identify any inflammation, obstruction, or other abnormalities.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis

Treatment: The patient should undergo an urgent appendectomy, either open or laparoscopic, depending on the surgeon's preference and the patient's condition. The patient should also receive broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as cefoxitin or cefotaxime, to cover for potential bacterial infections. Additionally, the patient should be monitored for any signs of complications, such as abscess formation or perforation, and receive supportive care, including pain management and hydration.
