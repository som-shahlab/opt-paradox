Last seen ___ at ___, at which time ERCP performed and 2 stones removed; last of these procedures was ___. No CCY or stent. DC'd day after procedure and has since never felt back to baseline with right flank pain, poor appetite, poor amublation and low energy. Today, again feeling acutely weak, with right flank pain, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, nausea but no  vomiting. Never f/c.

All other systems were reviewed and are negative.    Past Medical History: CKD (b/l Cr 1.5), IDT2DM, cholelithiasis, h/o Polymyalgia rheumatica, anemia (b/l ___   Social History: ___ Family History: Mother with diabetes, died of CVA in late age. Father MI age ___.  Brother with ___.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with recurrent flank pain, weakness, and other symptoms such as diaphoresis, lightheadedness, and nausea, which suggest a possible infection or obstruction in the urinary or biliary system. The patient's past medical history of CKD, cholelithiasis, and ERCP for gallstones is relevant. The laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin, elevated creatinine, and abnormal liver function tests. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of cholangitis or pyelonephritis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of cholangitis or pyelonephritis. The elevated liver function tests and alkaline phosphatase suggest a possible biliary obstruction. The patient's past medical history of cholelithiasis and ERCP for gallstones is relevant. The results of the lipase test are within normal limits, which makes acute pancreatitis less likely.

Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal tenderness, Murphy's sign, Costovertebral angle tenderness

ToolMessage:
"Exam on admission: VITALS: Afebrile and vital signs stable except elevated BP (see eFlowsheet) GENERAL: Alert and in no apparent distress EYES: Anicteric, pupils equally round ENT: Ears and nose without visible erythema, masses, or trauma.  Oropharynx without visible lesion, erythema or exudate CV: Heart regular, no murmur, no S3, no S4.  JVP at clavicle RESP: Lungs with faint rales right base that diminish but do not disappear with cough; good air movement bilaterally.  Breathing is non-labored GI: Abdomen soft, non-distended, non-tender to palpation.  Bowel sounds present.  Negative ___. Right flank/CVA (where pt indicates previous pain) no TTP. No ecchymoses GU: No suprapubic fullness or tenderness to palpation MSK: Neck supple, moves all extremities, strength grossly full and symmetric bilaterally in all limbs SKIN: No rashes or ulcerations noted. Specifically no ___ ulcers, no sacral breakdown NEURO: Alert, oriented, face symmetric, gaze conjugate with  EOMI, speech fluent, moves all limbs, sensation to light touch grossly intact throughout PSYCH: pleasant, appropriate affect  Exam"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of cholangitis or pyelonephritis. The elevated liver function tests and alkaline phosphatase suggest a possible biliary obstruction. The patient's past medical history of cholelithiasis and ERCP for gallstones is relevant. The physical examination results show no significant abdominal tenderness, but the patient has a history of right flank pain. The faint rales in the right base of the lungs could be indicative of a pulmonary issue or a referred pain from the abdomen.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Cholangitis
2. Pyelonephritis
3. Biliary obstruction
4. Pneumonia
5. Acute pancreatitis

Treatment: The patient should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as vancomycin and zosyn, to cover for possible cholangitis or pyelonephritis. The patient should also receive fluid resuscitation and pain management. Further imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The patient's liver function tests and alkaline phosphatase should be monitored closely. If the patient's condition worsens or does not improve with treatment, a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be necessary to evaluate for biliary obstruction.
