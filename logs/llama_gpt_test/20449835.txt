HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This is a ___ y/o female with a history notable for  nephrolithiasis, h/o cdiff ___ keflex), and depression,  who presents with acute epigastric abdominal pain, nausea and  vomiting x 2 days.  Patient reports that her pain began  yesterday afternoon as sharp, epigastric pain without radiation  ___, with continuous episodes of nausea and vomiting  (non-bloody, non-bilious).  The vomiting helped with her  abdominal pain slightly.  She had chills, but no fevers or  sweats.  No diarrhea. . She presented to ___ this morning due to persistent  symptoms, where exam was significant for epigastric TTP,  negative ___ sign.  Labs were notable for a lipase of 737  and AST/ALT in the 200s.  A RUQ u/s demonstrated small  gallstones in the gallbladder with 4mm wall thickening of the  GB, no fluid - ? acute vs. chronic cholecystitis.  She was given  IVF, zofran 4 mg IV x 1, and dilaudid 1 mg x 1.  She was  subsequently transferred to ___ for possible ERCP. . In the ED here, VS 99.2, 124/60, 88, 18, SaO2 98/RA.  She did  not receive any medications or IVF.  She reports she has not had  any further pain or vomiting since transfer from ___.  Pain  is currently ___.  She denies any new complaints.  No changes  in urination or stool.  . ROS: 10-point ROS is otherwise negative except for noted as  above.   Ms. ___ is a ___ F with a medical history notable for  Began to note epigastric and left-sided abdominal pain on ___.  She ___. Her evaluation in ___  was notable for a lipase of 700 and an ultrasound that revealed  cholelithiasis  Vital signs on arrival to ___ ED: T 99.2, P 88, BP 124/60, 98%  on RA. In the ED she received IV fluids.   Past Medical History: Hyperlipidemia Depression Allergic rhinitis h/o nephrolithiasis h/o cdiff colitis ___ s/p tubal ligatgion ___   Social History: ___ Family History: CAD s/p CABG in both parents


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which suggests a possible gastrointestinal or pancreatic issue. The patient's history of nephrolithiasis, C. diff colitis, and depression is also notable. The laboratory results, including a lipase of 737 and AST/ALT in the 200s, indicate possible pancreatitis. The RUQ ultrasound showing small gallstones and 4mm wall thickening of the gallbladder suggests possible acute or chronic cholecystitis. 

Lab Interpretation: {
    "Lipase": {"value": 737, "interpretation": "high"},
    "AST": {"value": 200, "interpretation": "high"},
    "ALT": {"value": 200, "interpretation": "high"}
}
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal CT scan with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, an Abdominal CT scan with contrast, is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. The available imaging study is an MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC) (MRCP)."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest possible pancreatitis, and the RUQ ultrasound showed small gallstones and wall thickening of the gallbladder. An MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography) can help evaluate the pancreatic and biliary ducts for any obstruction or stones that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

Lab Interpretation: {
    "Lipase": {"value": 737, "interpretation": "high"},
    "AST": {"value": 200, "interpretation": "high"},
    "ALT": {"value": 200, "interpretation": "high"}
}
Action: imaging
Action Input: MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC)

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC), matches the available imaging study. Here is the full report:  **Study Name:** MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC)  **Report:**  **TECHNIQUE:** Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired on a 3.0 Tesla magnet including dynamic 3D imaging obtained prior to, during and after the uneventful intravenous administration of 18 mL of Magnevist IV; 300 mL of GastroMARK and 450 mL of Redicat were administered orally.  **FINDINGS:** There is minimal atelectasis noted at the right lung base. Multiple tiny layering gallstones are demonstrated within the gallbladder. No evidence for intrahepatic biliary dilatation. There is a T2 bright nonenhancing focus identified in segment II of the liver (Se 8:7) which may represent focal ectasia of the biliary tree or hepatic cysts (series 3, image 13). There is choledocholithiasis with a 3mm stone seen in the distal common bile duct (series 3, image 21) without upstream biliary dilation. The pancreas enhances normally with no evidence for ____. No pancreatic ductal dilatation, cyst or mass. No free fluid. Spleen and both adrenal glands are unremarkable. There are no retroperitoneal masses or adenopathy. Two haemorrhagic cysts are identified in the kidneys. The first measures 4mm in the upper pole of the left kidney (series 8, image 14) and the second measures 6mm in the lower pole of the right kidney (Se 5a:49). No worrisome renal masses or hydronephrosis. There are bilateral (Tarlov) perineural cysts identified at the T10/T11 vertebral level. Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformatted and subtraction images were generated on an independent workstation (966)."

AIMessage:
Thought: The MRCP study shows multiple tiny layering gallstones in the gallbladder, a 3mm stone in the distal common bile duct, and no evidence of pancreatic ductal dilatation, cyst, or mass. The presence of choledocholithiasis (a stone in the common bile duct) could be causing the patient's symptoms. The patient's elevated lipase and AST/ALT levels also suggest possible pancreatitis, but the MRCP study does not show any evidence of pancreatic inflammation. 

Lab Interpretation: {
    "Lipase": {"value": 737, "interpretation": "high"},
    "AST": {"value": 200, "interpretation": "high"},
    "ALT": {"value": 200, "interpretation": "high"}
}
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal tenderness, Murphy's sign, McBurney's point tenderness

ToolMessage:
"VS: 99.2, 124/60, 88, 18, 98/RA General: Pleasant, well-appearing female in NAD, AO x 3. HEENT: NC/AT, PERRL, EOMI.  Anicteric sclerae.  MM slightly dry,  OP clear. Neck: supple, no LAD.  Chest: CTA-B, no w/r/r CV: RRR s1 s2 normal, no m/g/r Abd: soft, NT/ND, NABS.  No HSM.  Negative ___ Ext: no c/c/e, wwp Neuro: AO x 3, non-focal exam"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination is largely unremarkable, with no significant abdominal tenderness, Murphy's sign, or McBurney's point tenderness. The patient's vital signs are also stable. Given the patient's laboratory results, imaging studies, and physical examination, it is likely that the patient has choledocholithiasis (a stone in the common bile duct) causing her symptoms. The elevated lipase and AST/ALT levels may be due to the stone causing pancreatic inflammation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Choledocholithiasis
2. Pancreatitis
3. Cholecystitis
4. Peptic ulcer disease
5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease

Treatment: The patient should undergo an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) to remove the stone from the common bile duct. The patient should also be treated with pain management, anti-emetics, and hydration. If the patient's pancreatitis is severe, she may require admission to the hospital for further management. Additionally, the patient's gallstones may need to be addressed with a cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder) in the future.
