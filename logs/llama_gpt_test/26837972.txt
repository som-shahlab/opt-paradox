HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ years old male with history of gluten intolerance presented  with fevers and abdominal pain since yesterday. Patient  developed fevers yesterday per patient as high as "107", patient  also reports 2 episodes of emesis yesterday - non bloody, crampy  diffuse abdominal pain, which improved overnight. Patient denies dysuria, sick contacts, had BM yesterday - non diarrhea. Patient  reports chills since yesterday, with intermittent headaches, no  SOB, no chest pain.  Of note patient has history of gluten intolerance and underwent  colonoscopy with upper endoscopy year ago at ___&W with biopsy,  with findings WNL, no celiac disease.    Past Medical History: PMH: gluten intolerance - diagnosed ___ year ago                                         PSH: sinus Sx/septoplasty  ___ ___&W   Social History: ___ Family History: father - newly dg. glioblastoma


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with fevers, abdominal pain, emesis, and chills, which could be indicative of an infectious or inflammatory process. The patient's history of gluten intolerance is also noteworthy, although the previous colonoscopy and upper endoscopy with biopsy did not show any evidence of celiac disease. Given the acute onset of symptoms, I would like to investigate further to determine the cause of the patient's condition.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count with a left shift (increased neutrophils), which may indicate a bacterial infection. The electrolyte panel and liver function tests are largely within normal limits. The lipase level is normal, which makes acute pancreatitis less likely. The urinalysis is unremarkable. Given the patient's symptoms of fevers, abdominal pain, and emesis, I would like to further investigate the cause of the patient's condition, particularly to rule out any infectious or inflammatory processes.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal CT scan with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for that study:  **EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST**  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Acquisition sequence:   1) Stationary Acquisition 5.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 24.1 mGy (Body) DLP = 12.0 mGy-cm.   2) Spiral Acquisition 6.4 s, 50.1 cm; CTDIvol = 10.7 mGy (Body) DLP = 537.3 mGy-cm.   Total DLP (Body) = 549 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**    **LOWER CHEST:** Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**    **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is fluid-filled with wall hyperemia measuring up to 1.0 cm (601:22). There is mild periappendiceal fat stranding. No evidence of microperforation or an adjacent organized fluid collection. No appendicolith is demonstrated.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The prostate and seminal vesicles are grossly unremarkable.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

AIMessage:
Thought: The abdominal CT scan with contrast shows a fluid-filled appendix with wall hyperemia and mild periappendiceal fat stranding, which is suggestive of acute appendicitis. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, fevers, and emesis are consistent with this diagnosis. Given the imaging findings and the patient's clinical presentation, I believe that acute appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination is consistent with acute appendicitis, with tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant and periumbilical area. The patient's vital signs also suggest an infectious or inflammatory process, with a slightly elevated temperature and heart rate.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Mesenteric lymphadenitis
4. Intestinal obstruction
5. Inflammatory bowel disease

Treatment: The patient should undergo urgent surgical consultation for possible appendectomy. In the meantime, the patient should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation to manage any potential infection and dehydration. The patient should also be closely monitored for any signs of worsening condition, such as increased pain, fever, or vomiting.
