HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with RLQ since 9am. Crampy. Associated with N/V with 10 episodes emesis since.  +BM today, normal. Denies vaginal pain and vaginal bleeding.  Reports feeling feverish earlier in the day    Past Medical History: none    Social History: ___ Family History: DM - grandmother, no cancer or cad in family


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain, crampy in nature, accompanied by nausea and vomiting (N/V) with 10 episodes of emesis since the onset of pain. The patient also reports feeling feverish earlier in the day. The presence of RLQ pain, especially when associated with nausea, vomiting, and a feeling of feverishness, raises suspicion for appendicitis, which is a common cause of acute abdominal pain requiring prompt medical attention. However, other differential diagnoses such as gastrointestinal infections, inflammatory bowel disease, or ovarian torsion (less likely given the denial of vaginal pain and bleeding) should also be considered. Given the acute presentation, laboratory tests and imaging studies would be crucial in narrowing down the differential diagnoses.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (15.8 K/uL) with a predominance of neutrophils (93.7%), indicating a potential acute bacterial infection. The basic metabolic panel (BMP) and electrolytes are largely within normal limits, although the potassium is slightly elevated at 5.0 mEq/L. The lipase level is within normal limits (20.0 IU/L), which makes acute pancreatitis less likely. The urinalysis shows a trace amount of protein and a few epithelial cells but is otherwise unremarkable. Given these results, the clinical suspicion for appendicitis or another cause of acute abdominal pain remains, but further evaluation, possibly with imaging, is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study. Here is the full report for the CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT images were acquired from the lung bases through the pubic symphysis following administration of intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformations were generated.  **FINDINGS:**  **CT ABDOMEN:**  - The lung bases are clear. - The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. - The liver demonstrates trace perifalciform fatty infiltration, but otherwise unremarkable. - The gallbladder, spleen, a small splenule, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. - Bilateral kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis or hydroureter. - The stomach, small and large bowel loops are normal in caliber. - No intra-abdominal adenopathy by size criteria. - No free air. - A retrocecal appendix is hyperemic and enlarged up to 12 mm near the tip, containing fluid and a few foci of air. Its inflammation is associated with a small amount of fluid in the right inferior edge of the peritoneal cavity and mild thickening of adjacent fascial planes (2, 60). - There is no overt evidence of abscess formation or perforation.  **CT PELVIS:**  - The bladder, distal ureters, uterus, and adnexa appear within normal limits. - A corpus luteal cyst may be present on the right. - No inguinal or pelvic sidewall adenopathy. - Trace fluid is seen in the pelvis."
