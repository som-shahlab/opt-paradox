AIMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of Crohn's ileitis and is presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, and emesis. The patient's last colonoscopy showed multiple aphthous ulcers in the terminal ileum, and they are currently on maintenance Pentasa. Given the patient's symptoms and history, it is possible that they are experiencing a flare-up of their Crohn's disease. However, other potential causes of their symptoms, such as intestinal obstruction or infection, need to be considered.

To further evaluate the patient's condition, laboratory tests and imaging studies would be helpful.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a potential inflammatory process. The C-Reactive Protein (CRP) level is also elevated, which is a marker of inflammation. The liver function tests are within normal limits. The patient's electrolyte panel and renal function tests (BUN and creatinine) are also within normal limits.

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it is likely that they are experiencing a flare-up of their Crohn's disease. However, other potential causes of their symptoms, such as intestinal obstruction or infection, need to be ruled out.

To further evaluate the patient's condition, imaging studies would be helpful.

Thought: The patient's laboratory results and history suggest a possible flare-up of their Crohn's disease. To further evaluate the patient's condition, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast would be helpful.

Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with Oral and Intravenous Contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"CT Abdomen and Pelvis with Oral and Intravenous Contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast, VoLumen, was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:**  - Acquisition sequence:    1) Stationary Acquisition 6.5 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 26.4 mGy (Body) DLP = 13.2 mGy-cm.   2) Spiral Acquisition 7.3 s, 57.1 cm; CTDIvol = 8.4 mGy (Body) DLP = 481.2 mGy-cm. - Total DLP (Body) = 494 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** There is bibasilar atelectasis without focal consolidation. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  - **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There are multiple subcentimeter hypodensities, which are too small to characterize, but statistically likely to represent cysts. Additionally, there is a small focal area of decreased attenuation along the ligamentum teres, likely focal fatty deposition. No concerning hepatic lesions are identified. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  - **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  - **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  - **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  - **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  - **GASTROINTESTINAL:** There is hyperemia and mural wall thickening of the terminal ileum (series 601; image 38, series 2; image 133) additionally, there is inflammation in the right mid abdomen with apparent extraluminal, hypodense collection measuring 3.4 x 2.4 x 1.7 cm (series 2; image 119, series 601; image 46). These findings are consistent with acute Crohn's disease with abscess and possible enteroenteric versus enterocolonic fistulization. No frank free air is seen. No small bowel obstruction.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. Moderate volume ascites is seen in the pelvis measuring intermediate density.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** Equivocal collapsed right-sided corpus luteum.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast shows hyperemia and mural wall thickening of the terminal ileum, consistent with acute Crohn's disease. There is also an apparent extraluminal, hypodense collection measuring 3.4 x 2.4 x 1.7 cm, which may represent an abscess or possible enteroenteric versus enterocolonic fistulization. These findings are consistent with a flare-up of the patient's Crohn's disease.

Given the patient's symptoms and imaging results, it is likely that they are experiencing a complication of their Crohn's disease, such as an abscess or fistula.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Crohn's disease with abscess and possible enteroenteric versus enterocolonic fistulization
2. Crohn's disease flare-up
3. Intestinal obstruction
4. Intra-abdominal infection
5. Other complications of Crohn's disease

Treatment: The patient should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for possible infection. They should also be started on corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. Additionally, the patient may require surgical intervention to drain the abscess or repair any fistulas. The patient's Pentasa dose may need to be adjusted or they may need to be started on a different medication, such as a biologic agent, to help manage their Crohn's disease. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of complications or worsening of their condition.
