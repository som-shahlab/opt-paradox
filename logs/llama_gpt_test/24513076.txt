HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with history of lupus recently off prednisone therapy presenting with acute onset of abdominal pain. Patient reports symptoms began last evening at 10PM in the ___  region, with worsening sharp pain throughout today. + Anorexia with nausea and multiple episodes of bilious emesis.    Patient denies previous symptoms. No known sick contacts or exposures. No diarrhea, hematochezia, or hematemesis. No dysuria or dysmenorrhea. LMP approximately 2 weeks ago, and regular.   Past Medical History: Depression   Subclinical hypothyroidism   Intermittent asthma   Chronic back pain   Lupus    Social History: ___ Family History: Dad with hypothyroidism. Dad and maternal grandmother with  ___ (?RA). Grandfather with stomach cancer.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute onset of abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, and bilious emesis, which suggests a possible gastrointestinal or abdominal pathology. The recent cessation of prednisone therapy in a patient with lupus could also be a contributing factor, as it may lead to a flare-up of the disease or exacerbate other conditions. Given the patient's complex medical history, including lupus, depression, subclinical hypothyroidism, intermittent asthma, and chronic back pain, a thorough evaluation is necessary to determine the cause of the abdominal pain.

If you need further information or additional tests, please let me know!"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (WBC) of 15.6 K/uL, which indicates a possible infection or inflammatory process. The rest of the complete blood count (CBC) parameters are within normal limits. The basic metabolic panel (BMP) results are also largely within normal limits, with no significant abnormalities noted. However, the lack of liver function tests, lipase, amylase, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) results limits our ability to fully assess the patient's condition.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for the CT scan:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Multi detector CT images through the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after the administration of intravenous contrast. No oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were generated and reviewed.  **DOSE:** 480 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  - **Chest:** The bases of the lungs are clear. Visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable.    - **Abdomen:** The liver appears homogeneous in attenuation with no focal lesion identified. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The portal vein is patent. The gallbladder is without radiopaque cholelithiasis. The pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are within normal limits. The kidneys present symmetric nephrograms and excretion of contrast. There is no hydronephrosis, perinephric stranding or fluid collection. The stomach, duodenum, and loops of small bowel are unremarkable. No evidence of bowel wall thickening or obstruction. The appendix is dilated and fluid-filled measuring 1.5 cm in dimension with surrounding inflammatory changes and thickening of the lateroconal fascia compatible with acute complicated appendicitis. There is no adjacent fluid collection or extraluminal air to suggest complication. The cecum and colon are unremarkable. There is trace abdominal free fluid. The aorta is normal in caliber without aneurysmal dilatation. There is no retroperitoneal adenopathy.    - **Pelvis:** The bladder is moderately well-distended and grossly unremarkable. The uterus and bilateral adnexa are within normal limits. There is trace pelvic free fluid. There is no inguinal or pelvic sidewall adenopathy. The rectum is unremarkable.    - **Osseous structures:** A sclerotic focus within the left ischium is likely a bone island. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.  **NOTIFICATION:** Findings were communicated to the ED physician caring for the patient, Dr. ___, by Dr. ___ via telephone at 6:55p on ___ at the time the study was reviewed."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast reveals a dilated and fluid-filled appendix with surrounding inflammatory changes, consistent with acute complicated appendicitis. The presence of trace abdominal and pelvic free fluid also supports this diagnosis. The rest of the abdominal and pelvic organs appear unremarkable. Given the patient's symptoms of acute onset abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, and bilious emesis, the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is highly likely.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination reveals focal tenderness in the right lower quadrant, which is consistent with the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The absence of Rovsing's sign does not rule out appendicitis, as this sign is not always present. The patient's vital signs are stable, and the rest of the physical examination is unremarkable.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Inflammatory bowel disease
4. Intestinal obstruction
5. Mesenteric lymphadenitis
Treatment: The patient should undergo urgent surgical consultation for possible appendectomy. In the meantime, the patient should be made nil per os (NPO) and started on intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Pain management should also be initiated. The patient's condition should be closely monitored, and any changes in symptoms or vital signs should be promptly addressed.
