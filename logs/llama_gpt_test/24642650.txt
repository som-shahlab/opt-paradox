HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ M presents w/ abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.  His symptoms began 1 week ago with sharp/crampy ___ abdominal pain associated with diarrhea.  After ___ days the pain was more localized to the RLQ.   He has had associated fevers up to 101.3 F recorded at home last night along with chills.  Admits to associated nausea and non-bilious, non-bloody emesis.  His appetite has been good.  Of note, patient has a history known history of ascending colon diverticulosis.  He also had EGD and colonoscopy in ___ for hematochezia.  The EGD was normal.  Colonoscopy only revealed polyps and ascending colon diverticulosis.  All polyps were benign and the one polyp removed from the cecum revealed  adenoma.    Past Medical History: lactose intolerance, cecal diverticulosis, colonic polyps s/p resection, headaches   Social History: ___ Family History: Father: history of diverticulosis, otherwise healthy.  Mother:healthy.  2 Brothers: healthy, older brother  s/p appendectomy.  Denies family history of inflammatory bowel disease or cancer.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fevers, and chills. The pain initially started as sharp/crampy and was diffuse, but later localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). This progression of symptoms, along with the associated fever and chills, suggests an infectious or inflammatory process. The patient's history of ascending colon diverticulosis and previous colonoscopy findings are also relevant. Given the acute presentation, it's essential to consider conditions such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or other causes of acute abdominal pain.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal tenderness, McBurney's Point Tenderness, Rebound tenderness, Guarding

ToolMessage:
"99.4 98.9 73 118/79 18 99RA NAD/A&O CTAB RRR  Abd soft, minimally tender"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination reveals a soft and minimally tender abdomen, which is somewhat atypical for conditions like appendicitis or diverticulitis, where significant tenderness, especially in the RLQ, is often expected. However, the absence of severe tenderness does not rule out these conditions entirely, as the presentation can vary. The patient's temperature is slightly elevated, which supports the presence of an infectious or inflammatory process. To further evaluate the cause of the patient's symptoms, laboratory tests would be helpful in assessing for signs of infection, inflammation, or other abnormalities.

AIMessage:
Thought: The laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count, which might suggest that the patient does not have a significant bacterial infection at this moment. However, the presence of fever and localized abdominal pain still warrants further investigation. The blood glucose level is significantly elevated, which could be related to stress, infection, or another underlying condition. The liver function tests and electrolytes are largely within normal limits. The lipase level is within the normal range, making acute pancreatitis less likely. Given the patient's history of diverticulosis and the clinical presentation, a CT scan of the abdomen could help in visualizing the intestines and confirming or ruling out diverticulitis or other causes of abdominal pain.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"CT Abdomen with IV contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report:  **CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Multidetector helical CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained after the administration of 130 cc IV Optiray contrast. Axial, coronal, and sagittal reformations were prepared.  **FINDINGS:** Within the base of the chest, no parenchymal lesions or pleural effusions are seen. Within the right lower quadrant, there is an area of inflammation, which appears to be centered predominantly around the posterior cecum. Multiple diverticula are noted including a diverticulum with hyperdense contents at the site of greatest inflammatory change. The appendix contains air throughout most of its length but the appendiceal tip is located adjacent to this region and appears to be inflamed, with mucosal hyperenhancement, and dilated measuring up to 7 mm (2:56). However, the area of most marked stranding is posterior to the appendiceal tip and there is only minimal stranding around the appendix itself. Several prominent lymph nodes are seen. No free fluid or free air is identified. The liver, spleen, pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands, and left kidney appear unremarkable. The right kidney contains a hypodensity, too small to characterize. Incidental note is made of a circumaortic left renal vein. The bladder, distal ureters and prostate gland appear normal. No concerning osseous lesion is seen."
