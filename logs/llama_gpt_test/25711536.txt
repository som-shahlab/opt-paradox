Patient History:
The patient is a ___ y/o F with pMHx significant for HTN, HLD,  GERD presenting with abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting and  transaminitis found a PCP's office.    Patient was in her usual state of health until ___ when she  noted abdominal pain and N/V after eating scallops for dinner.  She continued to have intermittent episodes of vomiting  overnight with resolution of her symptoms the next morning. She  had ___ days without recurrence and was able to take in POs  normally. On ___ she had additional RUQ/epigastric pain, N/V  and loose stools after eating fish for dinner that night.

Initial vitals in the ED: 98.4, 66, 151/71, 18, 100%RA   Labs notable for: lipase of 1089, AST: 441, ALT: 550, ALP: 192,  lactate 1.3, negative UA. H/H 12.6/35.8. RUQ ultrasound  difficult to assess but showed a collapsed gallbladder and  recommended repeating.   Patient given: 1L IVF    On the floor, patient reports feeling well. She denies pain,  N/V/D. Does endorse decreased appetite.    Review of Systems:  Positive as per HPI. All other review of  systems negative.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and GERD, presenting with abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and transaminitis after eating seafood. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of acute hepatitis or pancreatitis. However, the patient's lipase level is elevated, which is more indicative of pancreatitis. The patient's ultrasound results were difficult to assess, but a collapsed gallbladder was noted. To further evaluate the patient's condition, additional laboratory tests and imaging studies are needed.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, and ALP) and lipase, indicating possible pancreatitis or hepatitis. The hepatitis panel results are negative for hepatitis B and C, but positive for hepatitis A antibody, which is likely indicative of a past infection. The triglycerides level is within normal limits, making hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis less likely. The CBC with differential results shows a normal white blood cell count, and the electrolyte panel results are within normal limits. To further evaluate the patient's condition, additional imaging studies are needed to assess the pancreas and gallbladder.

Action Input: Abdominal CT scan, Repeat RUQ ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan,\" is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. However, there is a repeat RUQ ultrasound available. Here is the full report for the repeat RUQ ultrasound:  **LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound):**  **EXAMINATION:** LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  **TECHNIQUE:** Grey scale and color Doppler ultrasound images of the abdomen were obtained.  **FINDINGS:**  **GALLBLADDER:** The gallbladder is again noted to be partially collapsed. There is thickening of the fundal portion of the gallbladder wall with focal punctate echogenicities within this region of the gallbladder wall consistent with a fundal adenomyoma. No gallstones are visualized.  **BILIARY:** There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The extrahepatic common bile duct is normal measuring 0.6 cm.  **PANCREAS:** The visualized portions of the pancreas are within normal limits."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's repeat RUQ ultrasound results show a partially collapsed gallbladder with thickening of the fundal portion of the gallbladder wall and focal punctate echogenicities, consistent with a fundal adenomyoma. No gallstones are visualized. The biliary system appears normal, and the visualized portions of the pancreas are within normal limits. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it is possible that the patient has acute pancreatitis, possibly triggered by a gallbladder adenomyoma or other gallbladder pathology. However, the patient's symptoms have resolved, and the patient is currently asymptomatic. To determine the best course of action, a thorough review of the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results is needed.

The patient's liver enzymes should be monitored to ensure they return to normal.
