Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old female with ~24 hr h/o  acute abdominal pain. The patient states she had gradual onset  of midabdominal pain yesterday that hassince localized to the  RLQ. She was seen by her PCP and sent to the ___ ED for further management. She has had no  fevers/chills, no nausea/vomiting and has maintained a normal  appetite.     Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Cholelithiasis  Past Surgical History: lap CCY     Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain that has localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is a classic symptom of appendicitis. However, the patient's past medical history of cholelithiasis and past surgical history of laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CCY) could also be relevant. The patient's lack of fever, chills, nausea, and vomiting, and maintained normal appetite are also important considerations. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I would like to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (18.2 K/uL) with a high percentage of neutrophils (81.9%), indicating a possible bacterial infection. The basic metabolic panel (BMP) and liver function tests (LFTs) are largely unremarkable, but the absence of specific liver enzymes such as AST, ALT, and ALP makes it difficult to fully assess liver function. The urinalysis results are also mostly normal, but the presence of ketones (10.0 mg/dL) could indicate dehydration or a metabolic issue. However, the most notable absence is the lack of results for amylase and lipase, which are crucial for evaluating pancreatic pathology. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, I would like to interpret the available lab data and request additional imaging studies.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal CT scan with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Ultrasound,\" is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. However, the \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast\" matches the requested imaging. Here is the full report for the available imaging study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAM:** Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis.  **TECHNIQUE:** Contrast-enhanced MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of 130 mL of Omnipaque intravenous contrast. No oral contrast was administered. Reformatted coronal and sagittal images were also obtained.  **FINDINGS:**  **LUNG BASES:** There is minimal bilateral dependent atelectasis. No pleural or pericardial effusion is seen.  **ABDOMEN:** The patient appears to be status post cholecystectomy. There is minimal central intrahepatic biliary prominence as well as a dilated CBD to 1.2 cm. Findings may be secondary to post-cholecystectomy state, although consider correlation with LFTs. No focal intrahepatic lesion is seen. The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys uptake and excrete contrast symmetrically bilaterally. There is no hydronephrosis seen bilaterally. There is no evidence of bowel obstruction. No upper abdominal free fluid, free air, or lymphadenopathy is seen.  **PELVIS:** The appendix is dilated, measuring up to 1.2 cm in diameter with a thickened wall and possible very minimal adjacent stranding. No extraluminal gas or drainable fluid collection is seen. In the left adnexa, there is a 4.4 x 2.8 cm hypodense structure, possibly adnexal cyst, for which further evaluation with pelvic ultrasound is recommended. The right adnexa is unremarkable. Prominent areas of hypodensity in the region of the cervix may represent prominent nabothian cysts but can also be further evaluated on afore recommended pelvic ultrasound. The endometrium also appears slightly prominent. The bladder is somewhat collapsed, but is thin-walled.  **OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:** No concerning osteoblastic or lytic lesion is seen. There is loss of height of the superior L1 vertebral body with a prominent Schmorl's node seen. There is also mild loss of height of the T12 superior endplate with a Schmorl's node seen. There is lumbarization of S1."

AIMessage:
Thought: The abdominal CT scan with contrast shows a dilated appendix with a thickened wall and minimal adjacent stranding, which is highly suggestive of appendicitis. The presence of a dilated common bile duct (CBD) to 1.2 cm may be secondary to the patient's post-cholecystectomy state, but correlation with liver function tests (LFTs) is recommended. The CT scan also reveals a possible adnexal cyst in the left adnexa, which may require further evaluation with a pelvic ultrasound. However, given the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings, appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes, I would like to request a physical examination, specifically to assess for tenderness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ).
