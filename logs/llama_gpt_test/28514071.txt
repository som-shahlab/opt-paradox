AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with symptoms of vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal tenderness, which initially began 10 days ago and resolved after 48 hours, but reoccurred this morning. The patient has a history of hypertension and is taking lisinopril and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient also has a history of left breast DCIS, hypercholesterolemia, and rheumatic fever. The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible gastrointestinal or infectious cause. To further evaluate the patient, I would like to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a high white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. The patient's basic metabolic panel shows a slightly elevated creatinine level, which may indicate dehydration or kidney dysfunction. The liver function tests show slightly elevated AST and ALT levels, which may indicate liver inflammation or damage. To further evaluate the patient, I would like to interpret the laboratory results and order additional tests.

Action Input: Abdominal CT scan, Chest X-ray

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study is an Abdominal CT scan, which matches the available imaging study: CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT). Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT abdomen and pelvis  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Total DLP (Body) = 703 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Imaged lung bases notable for mild atelectasis and emphysema. The imaged portion of the heart is unremarkable. No pleural or pericardial effusion. Breast reconstruction is noted bilaterally.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver enhances normally without focal concerning lesion. There may be mild hepatic steatosis. Main portal vein is patent. Biliary ducts are nondilated. The gallbladder is contracted around a large calcified stone. There is a small volume of perihepatic ascites.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas enhances normally without signs of pancreatitis or focal lesion.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen is normal.  **ADRENALS:** Adrenal glands are normal bilaterally.  **URINARY:** The kidneys enhance symmetrically though there is no excretion of contrast from either kidney for which clinical correlation is advised. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. Parapelvic cysts are noted bilaterally.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is mostly decompressed. The duodenum appears normal. Loops of small bowel demonstrate no signs of ileus or obstruction. The appendix is not visualized though there are no secondary signs of appendicitis. The colon notable for diverticulosis. Fluid tracks along the pericolic gutter bilaterally. There is a perisigmoid fluid collection best seen on series 2, image 68 measuring 3.8 x 5.2 x 4.0 cm consistent with abscess. There is an adjacent inflamed diverticulum and findings are compatible with complicated ____. No free air.  **PELVIS:** Urinary bladder is decompressed. There is a thin walled cystic structure in the left low anterior pelvis measuring 4.3 x 5.2 x 4.2 cm which may represent a left adnexal cystic structure which requires further evaluation by ultrasound once the acute symptoms resolve. Uterus is surgically absent. No right adnexal mass is seen. No pelvic sidewall or inguinal adenopathy.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild to moderate atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** Multilevel degenerative changes of without worrisome lytic oral blastic focal osseous lesion. There is mild anterior compression of the L1 vertebra which is likely chronic.  **SOFT TISSUES:** Surgical clips are noted in the anterior abdominal wall. No hernia is seen."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a perisigmoid fluid collection consistent with an abscess, and an adjacent inflamed diverticulum, which is compatible with complicated diverticulitis. The patient's laboratory results also show a high white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection. The patient's symptoms and imaging results suggest a diagnosis of diverticulitis with abscess formation. To further evaluate the patient, I would like to interpret the imaging results and develop a treatment plan.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination shows left lower quadrant tenderness and a slight mass appreciated in the left lower quadrant, which is consistent with the diagnosis of diverticulitis with abscess formation. The patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging results all support this diagnosis. The patient's treatment plan should include antibiotics and possible drainage of the abscess.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Diverticulitis with abscess formation
2. Dehydration
3. Acute kidney injury
4. Electrolyte imbalance
5. Sepsis
Treatment: The patient should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, and bowel rest. The patient should also receive fluid resuscitation and electrolyte replacement. Possible drainage of the abscess may be necessary, either percutaneously or surgically. The patient's condition should be closely monitored, and the patient should be evaluated for possible complications, such as sepsis or abscess rupture.
