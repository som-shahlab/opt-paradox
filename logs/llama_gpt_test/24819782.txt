AIMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of non-resectable cholangiocarcinoma stage IV and is presenting with increasing abdominal pain, specifically in the left upper quadrant (LUQ), which is constant and cramping in nature. The patient's recent procedure of PTC and exchange of internal-external biliary drainage catheter may be related to the current symptoms. Given the patient's complex medical history, including chemotherapy and biliary drainage, it is essential to evaluate the current laboratory values and imaging studies to determine the cause of the abdominal pain.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT), alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin levels, indicating liver dysfunction. The patient's white blood cell count is within normal limits, and the hemoglobin level is low, which may be related to the patient's chronic disease. Given the patient's history of cholangiocarcinoma and biliary drainage, the elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin levels may be related to the biliary obstruction or tumor progression.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study. Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT axial images were obtained from the dome of the liver to the pubic symphysis after the uneventful administration of IV and oral contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were provided and reviewed.  **ABDOMEN:** The visualized lung bases demonstrate bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The imaged portion of the heart is unremarkable and there is no pericardial effusion. Again seen throughout the liver is diffuse metastatic disease from known cholangiocarcinoma. The size and number of metastatic sites has increased from prior. The largest of which is seen at the dome of the liver and measures 9.2 x 6.1 cm (2:9). New lesions are seen within the left lobe of the liver, for example, one measuring 1.3 x 0.9 cm (2:20) which also demonstrates a faint rim of enhancement. Again a more heterogeneous infiltrative mass occupies the majority of the right lobe of the liver. A left-side percutaneous biliary drain and a right side metallic biliary drain stent are in place with an unchanged degree of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The right portal vein is again noted to be occluded, and left portal vein is patent. The gallbladder is again noted to be distended with a thickened wall, unchanged from prior study. There are multiple retroperitoneal lymph nodes which are unchanged from prior. For example, a 2.1 x 1.5 cm node is seen adjacent to the left kidney (2:32), another one slightly superior to this measures 2.2 cm. Multiple precardiac lymph nodes have increased in size from prior. There is no free air or free fluid. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast without hydronephrosis. The spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The pancreatic duct is prominent but otherwise the pancreas is unremarkable. The aorta and its major branches are normal. There is no peritoneal hyperenhancement to suggest peritonitis or nodularity to suggest peritoneal carcinomatosis. The stomach, large and small bowel are normal.  **PELVIS:** The bladder and rectum are normal. There is a moderate amount of free pelvic fluid, increased from prior. The left side gonadal veins are again noted to be dilated.  **BONES:** There are no suspicious osseous lesions."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan shows progression of the metastatic disease from cholangiocarcinoma, with an increase in the size and number of metastatic sites in the liver. The presence of a heterogeneous infiltrative mass in the right lobe of the liver, occlusion of the right portal vein, and intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation suggests biliary obstruction. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice are consistent with the imaging findings. Given the patient's advanced disease and poor prognosis, the focus should be on palliative care and management of symptoms.

5. Jaundice due to biliary obstruction
Treatment: The patient's treatment plan should focus on palliative care and management of symptoms. This may include:
* Pain management with opioids and other analgesics
* Management of biliary obstruction with stenting or drainage
* Nutrition support to address malnutrition and weight loss
* Symptomatic treatment of jaundice and pruritus
* Consideration of hospice care or palliative care services to support the patient and their family.
