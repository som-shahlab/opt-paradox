HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ history of hypothyroidism and celiac disease who presents with abdominal pain. Starting at 10pm last night, she reports onset of pain ___ that was sharp and non-radiating. This morning, the pain migrated to her RLQ with associated nausea and dry-heaving. Denies changes in bowel function, fevers, hematochezia/melena. No sick contacts. Last drank water at 5am.   Past Medical History: PMH:  hypothyroidism celiac disase (diagnosed age ___ HLD bilateral frozen shoulders s/p repair  PSH: b/l shoulder surgery for frozen shoulder R wrist surgery s/p trauma    Social History: ___ Family History: FH: Mother- colon cancer ___ at age ___, died at age ___.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain that started as sharp and non-radiating, then migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) with associated nausea and dry-heaving. This clinical presentation is suggestive of appendicitis, especially given the migration of pain to the RLQ. However, the patient's history of celiac disease may also increase the risk of other abdominal pathologies, such as intestinal obstruction or celiac crisis. The patient's history of hypothyroidism is also noteworthy, as it may affect the patient's overall health and increase the risk of certain complications. To further evaluate the patient's condition, laboratory tests and imaging studies are necessary.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The basic metabolic panel and liver function tests are largely within normal limits, although the glucose result is not provided. The lipase level is within normal limits, which makes pancreatitis less likely. However, the clinical presentation of abdominal pain migrating to the RLQ with associated nausea and dry-heaving still suggests appendicitis as a possible diagnosis. To further evaluate the patient's condition, imaging studies are necessary.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study is an Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan, which matches the available imaging study: CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT). Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast.  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Total DLP (Body) = 397 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** There is bibasilar atelectasis. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Diverticulosis of the colon is noted, without evidence of wall thickening nor fat stranding. The appendix is dilated at its mid to distal portion to 12 mm, with mild surrounding fat stranding. There is no extraluminal air nor drainable collection.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is trace free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The uterus and bilateral adnexae are within normal limits.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  **SOFT TISSUES:** An umbilical hernia containing fat is noted.  **NOTIFICATION:** The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 10:00 am, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast shows a dilated appendix with surrounding fat stranding, which is consistent with appendicitis. The patient's clinical presentation of abdominal pain migrating to the RLQ with associated nausea and dry-heaving, combined with the imaging findings, supports the diagnosis of appendicitis. The presence of diverticulosis of the colon is also noted, but it does not appear to be the cause of the patient's current symptoms.

Lab Interpretation: None (no new laboratory values provided)
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Tenderness to palpation in the RLQ, McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination is consistent with appendicitis, as evidenced by tenderness to palpation in the RLQ, positive Rovsing's sign, and positive obturator sign. The presence of these signs, combined with the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings, strongly supports the diagnosis of appendicitis. 

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Appendicitis
2. Diverticulitis
3. Intestinal obstruction
4. Celiac crisis
5. Pancreatitis

Treatment: The patient should undergo urgent surgical consultation for possible appendectomy. The patient should be made NPO and started on IV fluids and antibiotics. Pain management should be initiated, and the patient should be closely monitored for any signs of worsening condition or complications. 

Note: The patient's history of celiac disease and hypothyroidism should be taken into consideration when managing the patient's care, and any necessary adjustments to treatment should be made accordingly.
