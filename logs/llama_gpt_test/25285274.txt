HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ presents to the ED with RLQ pain that started yesterday afternoon at noon and progressed over this time associated with nausea and vomiting. She has never experienced pain similar to this before.  No recent sick contacts, travel or abnormal foods.   She is not currently sexually active. She denies fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, dysuria, frequency, flank pain, back pain, diarrhea, bloody stool, abnormal menses, vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding, sexual activity.  Surgery is now consulted for continued management.   Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: Mother-diabetes


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are classic symptoms of appendicitis. However, other causes of RLQ pain, such as ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, or intestinal obstruction, must also be considered. The patient's denial of fever, chills, and other systemic symptoms does not rule out appendicitis, as some patients may not exhibit these symptoms early in the course of the disease. Given the patient's symptoms and the need for a thorough evaluation, laboratory tests and imaging studies are necessary to determine the cause of the RLQ pain.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a elevated white blood cell count (22.8 K/uL) with a predominance of neutrophils (85.8%), which suggests an acute inflammatory process. The urinalysis results are relatively unremarkable, with only a trace amount of protein and a few red and white blood cells. The negative beta-hCG test makes ectopic pregnancy less likely, but does not completely rule it out. The lack of ESR and CRP results limits the interpretation of the inflammatory response. Given the clinical presentation and laboratory results, imaging studies are necessary to further evaluate the cause of the RLQ pain.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal CT scan with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT): TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT scan through the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of 130 cc Omnipaque intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained. DLP: 738.01 mGy-cm. FINDINGS: In the right lung base a pleural based nodule measures 3 mm; otherwise, the lung bases are clear. In the absence of risk factors no follow-up is recommended. The heart size is normal. The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesions. The portal vein is patent. The gallbladder is normal. The pancreas, spleen and adrenal glands appear normal. Bilateral, right greater than left, renal polar areas of hypoattenuation and cortical thinning are identified. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. The stomach is filled with contrast and appears normal. The small and large bowel are unremarkable without evidence of obstruction or focal wall thickening. A dilated fluid-filled structure measuring 9 mm in diameter with hyperenhancing mucosa represents an inflamed appendix. There is surrounding fat stranding. There is no evidence of free air or adjacent fluid collections to indicate rupture. The bladder is filled and appears normal. The uterus and adnexa are unremarkable. The aorta is normal in caliber. There is prominent mesenteric lymphadenopathy that is likely reactive. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no concerning osteoblastic or osteolytic lesions."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan with contrast shows an inflamed appendix with surrounding fat stranding, which is consistent with acute appendicitis. The absence of free air or adjacent fluid collections suggests that the appendix has not ruptured. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including the elevated white blood cell count, are also consistent with acute appendicitis. Given the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, surgical consultation is appropriate to discuss treatment options, including appendectomy.

Thought: The patient's physical examination results are consistent with acute appendicitis, as evidenced by tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant and McBurney's point tenderness. The presence of these signs, combined with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including the elevated white blood cell count, and the CT scan findings of an inflamed appendix, confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute appendicitis
