HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ presents from ___ with abd pain and vomiting. Pt  initally presented to ___ last night. Pain is diffuse,  started yesterday and assocaited with emesis x3. No diarrhea or  fever. At ___ pt found to have pericholecystic fluid, CBD  dilation and a possible stone in the common bile duct. Patient  was given IV Unasyn and IV fluids prior to transfer. Patient's  white count was 16. LFTs and lipase are not elevated. In ___ ED AVSS and did not require pain medication. On arrival to floor pt reports mild RUQ abd pain. No nausea  currently. No other complaints.  ROS: +as above, otherwise reviewed and negative    Past Medical History: Dry eyes cholelithiasis   Social History: ___ Family History: no GB disease


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain and vomiting, and initial evaluation revealed pericholecystic fluid, CBD dilation, and a possible stone in the common bile duct. The patient's white count is elevated at 16, but LFTs and lipase are not elevated. Given the patient's history of cholelithiasis and the presence of pericholecystic fluid, CBD dilation, and a possible stone in the common bile duct, it is likely that the patient has a gallstone-related issue, such as choledocholithiasis or cholecystitis.

Lab Interpretation: 
{
    "WBC": {"value": 16, "interpretation": "high"},
    "LFTs": {"value": "not elevated", "interpretation": "normal"},
    "Lipase": {"value": "not elevated", "interpretation": "normal"}
}
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, MRCP

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, Abdominal Ultrasound, MRCP, is not available in the provided list. The available imaging study is a LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound)."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's initial evaluation revealed pericholecystic fluid, CBD dilation, and a possible stone in the common bile duct. The patient's white count is elevated, but LFTs and lipase are not elevated. Given the patient's history of cholelithiasis and the presence of pericholecystic fluid, CBD dilation, and a possible stone in the common bile duct, it is likely that the patient has a gallstone-related issue, such as choledocholithiasis or cholecystitis. An ultrasound of the liver and gallbladder may help confirm the diagnosis.

    "WBC": {"value": 16, "interpretation": "high"},
    "LFTs": {"value": "not elevated", "interpretation": "normal"},
    "Lipase": {"value": "not elevated", "interpretation": "normal"}
}
Action: imaging
Action Input: LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN),\" matches the available imaging study. Here is the full report:  **LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound):**  **FINDINGS:** The liver demonstrates normal echogenicity. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common bile duct is mildly dilated measuring up to 11 mm and contains a 6 mm stone. The gallbladder is mildly distended and contains some sludge, however there is no significant gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. The portal vein is patent. Visualized portions of the pancreas are unremarkable without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic duct dilatation. A 11 mm nonobstructive stone is seen in the lower pole of the right kidney. There is no hydronephrosis."

AIMessage:
Thought: The ultrasound findings confirm the presence of a stone in the common bile duct, which is consistent with choledocholithiasis. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including an elevated white count, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Given the patient's history of cholelithiasis and the presence of a stone in the common bile duct, it is likely that the patient has choledocholithiasis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Choledocholithiasis
2. Cholecystitis
