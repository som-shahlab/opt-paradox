HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
HPI: ___ w/no medical hx who p/w with ___ days of generalized  abdominal pain and a 1 day history of RLQ pain. Pt is a ___  student who had a generalized abdominal discomfort last week  which he thought was constipation. This discomfort/constipation  dissipated 3 days ago and the pt was having normal BMs. However,  2 nights ago the pt developed more severe pain in his lower  abdomen. The following morning the pain was still present but  the pt managed to have a banana and granola bar for breakfast.  He had little appetite during the rest of the day and by 5pm  yesterday afternoon the pain had escalated and localized to the  RLQ. When asked to point with one finger at the location of his  pain pt pointed to ___'s. He also was nauseated but no  vomiting. No fever or chills. No diarrhea or dysuria. No prior  episodes of similar pain.    Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a history of generalized abdominal pain that has localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is a classic symptom of appendicitis. The patient's symptoms have progressed over time, starting with generalized abdominal discomfort, followed by more severe pain in the lower abdomen, and finally localizing to the RLQ. The patient's nausea and lack of appetite are also consistent with appendicitis. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I would like to order some laboratory tests and imaging studies.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which is consistent with a possible infectious or inflammatory process. The urinalysis results show some abnormalities, including the presence of red blood cells, protein, and bacteria, which could indicate a urinary tract infection. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more suggestive of appendicitis. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I would like to order an imaging study.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study is an Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan, which matches the available imaging study: CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT). Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Contiguous MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis were performed after the administration of intravenous contrast. Axial, coronal, and sagittal reformats were acquired.  **FINDINGS:**  **CT OF THE ABDOMEN:** The lung bases are clear with no focal hepatic lesions. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, both adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. The portal venous, systemic venous, and systemic arterial system of the abdomen and pelvis are normal. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The stomach and small bowel are normal. There is ____ with the appendix measuring about 3.4 x 2.4 cm at the origin of the cecal base and 3.5 x 3.4 cm at its mid portion at the level of the appendicolith. There is associated periappendiceal phlegmonous fat stranding, most pronounced between the appendix and the right psoas muscle (series 601B, image 27). There is no free air. A small amount of free fluid is seen in the pelvis (series 2, image 66).  **CT OF THE PELVIS:** The prostate gland, urinary bladder, and seminal vesicles are normal without pelvic lymphadenopathy, and a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. A benign appearing (likely non-ossifying fibroma) bone lesions is seen at the right proximal femur."
