HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ who presents with ___ days of abdominal pain, nausea and overall malaise. Evaluated at ___ over the weekend and treated with cipro/flagyl for presumed diverticulitis. Patient endorses initial improvement in symptoms, until ___ when she began to deteriorate. Her WBC increased on repeat eval at ___ today and she was sent to the ED for further evaluation. She reports nausea, dry heaving, no frank emesis. She reports diarrhea since starting abx on ___, which she describes as liquid, orange in color, BMx3/day for the last three days. She denies pain with urination, denies urinary frequency, denies blood in her urine, denies flank pain. Denies fevers and chills. Denies HA. Denies shortness of breath or congestion, reports lingering cough s/p URI a few weeks ago. She has never had a colonoscopy.    Past Medical History: Hypertension Migraines Obesity Basal cell carcinoma s/p Mohs    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother - DM Father - COPD, ___ disease Sister - brain aneurysm age ___ Sister - HTN, CVA, melanoma Brother - DM Daughter - asthma


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and malaise, which initially improved with cipro/flagyl treatment for presumed diverticulitis, but then deteriorated. The increase in WBC count and the development of diarrhea after starting antibiotics suggest a possible complication or an alternative diagnosis. The patient's symptoms and history require further evaluation to determine the cause of her condition.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection or inflammatory process. The basic metabolic panel results are relatively normal, but the lack of liver function tests and other specific test results limits the ability to fully assess the patient's condition. The presence of diarrhea after starting antibiotics raises the suspicion of Clostridioides difficile infection, but the results of the stool studies and Clostridioides difficile toxin assay are not available.

Action Input: Abdominal CT scan, Chest X-ray

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study is an Abdominal CT scan. The available imaging study that best matches this request is the \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Total DLP (Body) = 718 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  - **LOWER CHEST:** The bases of lungs are clear.    - **ABDOMEN:** Multiple hypodense lesions are seen throughout the liver, with the largest in the right hepatic lobe measuring 2.1 cm x 2.7 cm, series 2, image 19 likely secondary to biliary hamartomas. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is normal without evidence of stones, or wall thickening. The spleen is homogeneous and normal in size. A calcified granuloma is seen along the superior aspect of the spleen. The adrenal glands bilaterally are normal. The kidneys bilaterally are normal without evidence of focal solid or cystic lesions concerning for malignancy. The pancreas is normal without evidence of focal lesions, or pancreatic ductal dilatation. The stomach appears to be unremarkable. Within the deep right pelvis, there is a large abscess, with air-fluid levels, measuring 8.9 cm x 8.1 cm by 8.9 cm, replacing the appendix. The ascending colon demonstrates mild thickening, consistent with colitis. Inflammatory changes are seen surrounding the abscess. The remainder of the bowel is unremarkable.  - **CT PELVIS:** The urinary bladder is normal. Within the pelvis, bilateral tubal ligation clips are seen. There is a small amount of pelvic free fluid. There is no pelvic wall or inguinal lymphadenopathy, however prominent lymph nodes are seen surrounding the large collection, for example the largest node in the right hemipelvis, series 2, image 55 measuring 1.3 cm x 0.9 cm.  - **Osseous structures:** No lytic or blastic lesions concerning for malignancy are identified. T11 hemangioma."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a large abscess in the deep right pelvis, replacing the appendix, with air-fluid levels and surrounding inflammatory changes. This suggests a possible diagnosis of appendicitis or a perforated appendix. The presence of multiple hypodense lesions in the liver is also noted, but their significance is unclear. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including the elevated white blood cell count, support the possibility of an infectious or inflammatory process.

Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal tenderness, Rebound tenderness, McBurney's point tenderness

ToolMessage:
"General: well appearing, NAD  HEENT: normocephalic, atraumatic, no scleral icterus  Resp: breathing comfortably on room air  CV: regular rate and rhythm on monitor  Abdomen: soft, appropriately tender, but improved from  admission, drain in place draining cloudy, purulent appearing  fluid.  Extremities: Warm and well perfused"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination shows abdominal tenderness, which is consistent with the CT scan findings of an abscess in the deep right pelvis. The presence of a drain in place draining cloudy, purulent-appearing fluid suggests that the patient has undergone a procedure to drain the abscess. The patient's overall appearance and vital signs are stable, but the abdominal tenderness and presence of a drain indicate a need for continued monitoring and management of the patient's condition.
