HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with history of IBS who presents with abdominal pain. Pain started ~6:30 this morning, ___, periumbilical with eventual migration to the RLQ, worsened with movement. She subsequently developed nausea and several episodes of emesis after attempting to eat breakfast. Patient reports that this pain is different from her IBS pain. Denies fevers, chills, dysuria, back pain. Currently, both nausea and pain has improved. Last meal was dinner the night previous. Patient has been attempting to get pregnant; last LMP in  ___.    Past Medical History: IBS    Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain that started periumbilically and migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is a classic symptom of appendicitis. However, the patient also has a history of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), which can cause abdominal pain. The patient's nausea, emesis, and improvement of symptoms are non-specific and can be seen in various conditions. To further evaluate the patient, I need to consider the possibility of appendicitis, IBS exacerbation, and other potential causes of abdominal pain, such as ovarian torsion or ectopic pregnancy, given the patient's attempts to get pregnant.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count (16.4 K/uL) with a high percentage of neutrophils (87.0%), which may indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The negative beta-hCG test makes ectopic pregnancy less likely. The urinalysis shows a few mucous cells and a trace amount of blood, but no significant evidence of urinary tract infection. The electrolyte panel is largely within normal limits. Given these results, I would like to further evaluate the patient's abdominal pain with imaging studies.

"The requested imaging study is an \"Abdominal CT scan,\" which matches the available \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Multi detector CT images through the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after the uneventful administration of intravenous contrast. No oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were generated and reviewed. DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 446 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  - **Chest:** Bibasilar atelectasis is mild and symmetric. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. - **Liver:** The liver is homogeneous in attenuation without focal hepatic lesion identified. Portal veins are patent. There is no intrahepatic biliary duct dilation. - **Gallbladder:** The gallbladder is surgically absent. - **Pancreas, Spleen, and Bilateral Adrenal Glands:** Normal. - **Kidneys:** The kidneys present symmetric nephrograms and excretion of contrast. There is no focal renal lesion, hydronephrosis, or perinephric fluid collection. - **Stomach, Duodenum, and Loops of Small Bowel:** Normal in appearance. - **Appendix:** The appendix is dilated at its mid portion to the tip measuring up to 10 mm in diameter with hyperemia, surrounding soft tissue stranding and trace fluid. There is no thickening of the cecum. Remaining large bowel is unremarkable. - **Abdominal Aorta:** Normal in caliber without aneurysmal dilatation. - **Retroperitoneal or Mesenteric Adenopathy:** None. - **Pelvis:** The bladder is moderately well distended and grossly unremarkable. High density material within the ascending colon as well as terminal ileum is of unclear significance. Uterus and adnexa are unremarkable, better assessed on same date pelvic ultrasound. Pelvic free fluid is trace. There is no inguinal or pelvic sidewall adenopathy. No osseous lesion worrisome for malignancy or infection is identified. Slight expansion of the spinal canal at the mid sacrum raising possibility of underlying Tarlov cysts.  **NOTIFICATION:** The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the ___ ___ at 6:40 ___, 1 minute after discovery of the findings."
