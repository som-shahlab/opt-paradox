HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Per admitting resident: Ms. ___ is a ___ who presnted to  the ED with epigastric pain which began around 1pm yesterday, ___. She has  since developed nausea, vomiting (non-bloody), PO intolerance,  and suprapubic pain. She has history of gastric sleeve by Dr.  ___ in ___. She initally presented to ___. At ___  she had a CT A/P which was read as negative for acute process.  She was given Unasyn Toradol morphine and Zofran at that time. She then went home and saw her primary care this morning, and  had a white blood cell count which had increased to 21.3, from  13.4. Hct WNL.  Lipase WNL. She was transferred to ___, and  from there here for bariatric surgery evaluation.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: GERD, H. pylori, PCOS  Past Surgical History: sleeve gastrectomy ___, CESAREAN SECTION  x2, hysterectomy    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother obese.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and suprapubic pain, which began yesterday. She has a history of gastric sleeve surgery and has been experiencing symptoms despite initial treatment with Unasyn, Toradol, morphine, and Zofran. Her white blood cell count has increased to 21.3, indicating a potential infection or inflammatory process. Given her history of bariatric surgery, I need to consider complications related to the surgery, such as leaks, abscesses, or bowel obstruction.

Lab Interpretation: {
    "WBC": {"value": 21.3, "interpretation": "high"},
    "Hct": {"value": "WNL", "interpretation": "normal"},
    "Lipase": {"value": "WNL", "interpretation": "normal"}

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal CT with contrast, Upper GI series

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAMINATION:** CT abdomen and pelvis  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. Oral contrast was not administered.  **DOSE:** Found no primary dose record and no dose record stored with the sibling of a split exam.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Lung bases are clear.  **ABDOMEN:**  - **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 2.1 cm area of hypoenhancement is seen in the right hepatic lobe along the falciform ligament, which may reflect focal fatty deposition. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.    - **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.    - **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.    - **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.    - **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. A tiny hypodensity is seen in the lateral left kidney, too small to characterize but likely representing a renal cyst. No other focal renal lesions are seen. There is no perinephric abnormality.    - **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The patient is status post gastric sleeve procedure. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness and enhancement throughout. Colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is dilated to 13 mm, consistent with ____. There is a new fluid collection adjacent to the tip of the appendix, measuring 4.2 x 4.4 x 2.7 cm, and associated locules of air free air (2:66), suggestive of a perforated ____. There is no evidence of mesenteric lymphadenopathy.    - **RETROPERITONEUM:** There is no evidence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.    - **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is no calcium burden in the abdominal aorta and great abdominal arteries.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** Reproductive organs are within normal limits.  **BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions. There is no fracture. Abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  **NOTIFICATION:** After multiple unsuccessful attempts of paging the resident Dr. ___ the attending Dr. ___ were communicated via text page to Dr. ___ at 2:54 a.m. ___. Findings were communicated to Dr. ___ at 3:04 am on ___ by phone."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan with contrast shows a fluid collection adjacent to the tip of the appendix, measuring 4.2 x 4.4 x 2.7 cm, with associated locules of air, suggestive of a perforated appendix. This is a significant finding, given the patient's symptoms of epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and suprapubic pain. The presence of a perforated appendix is a surgical emergency, and the patient likely requires urgent surgical intervention.

Lab Interpretation: {

Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal tenderness, Rebound tenderness, McBurney's Point Tenderness

ToolMessage:
"VSS, afebrile, hemodynamically stable General: NAD, A&O x3 Cardiovascular: Normal rate, regular rhythm, S1/S2, no m/r/g Pulmonary: No respiratory distress, CTAB, no adventitious sounds   Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, non-distended, steri-strips c/d/i  over surgical incisions, no signs of infection Extremities: WWP, palpable pedal pulses b/l ___"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination shows no significant abdominal tenderness, rebound tenderness, or McBurney's point tenderness, which is unexpected given the CT scan findings of a perforated appendix. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including a high white blood cell count, suggest an underlying infectious or inflammatory process. Given the patient's history of gastric sleeve surgery, I need to consider the possibility of a complication related to the surgery, such as a leak or abscess.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Perforated appendix
2. Gastric sleeve leak or abscess
3. Small bowel obstruction
4. Intra-abdominal infection
5. Adhesions or bowel ischemia

Treatment: The patient requires urgent surgical evaluation and likely surgical intervention for the perforated appendix. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated to cover for potential intra-abdominal infection. The patient should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis or hemodynamic instability. A surgical consultation with a bariatric surgeon or general surgeon is necessary to determine the best course of treatment.
