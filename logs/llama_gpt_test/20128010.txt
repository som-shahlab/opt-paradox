Since discharge,  the pt has gradually increased her diet intake, but she has still  not regained her baseline appetite.  One day prior to admission, she reports an increase ___ her lower abdominal pain.  It is worse with movement.  It is not associated with eating; she denies nausea or vomiting; she has poor appetite.  No fevers or chills at home (recorded temperatures ___.  She has noted urinary frequency without dysuria.  Normal bowel movements as well.     Past Medical History: None.   Social History: ___ Family History: Father - MI early ___.  No history of bowel disease.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of recent right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, fevers, and anorexia, and was diagnosed with terminal ileitis and a periappendiceal abscess. She was treated with a 2-week course of cipro and flagyl, which she completed. However, she has not regained her baseline appetite and has recently experienced an increase in lower abdominal pain, worse with movement. Given her recent history of abdominal infection and abscess, I need to consider the possibility of complications or recurrence of infection.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated WBC count (12.2 K/uL) and CRP (25.5 mg/L), indicating a possible infection or inflammatory process. The ESR is also elevated (78.0 mm/hr), which suggests chronic inflammation. The urinalysis results show few bacteria, but no other significant abnormalities. Given these results, I need to consider the possibility of a recurrent or persistent infection, such as a recurrent abscess or ongoing bowel infection.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, CT Scan of the Abdomen and Pelvis

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"CT Scan of the Abdomen and Pelvis,\" is available. Here is the full report:  **CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT): CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis following the administration of 130 cc of Optiray and oral contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also obtained.  **CT OF THE ABDOMEN:** Limited images through the lung bases are unremarkable. There are no pleural effusions. The liver is normal in size and contour. There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. There is a hypoenhancing geographic area along the falciform ligament likely reflecting focal fatty infiltration. The gallbladder is unremarkable. The portal and superior mesenteric veins are patent. The spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands are within normal limits. The kidneys enhance symmetrically. There is no hydronephrosis. Multiple small retroperitoneal lymph nodes are identified that measure less than 1 cm in short axis and may be reactive in nature.  **CT OF THE PELVIS:** There has been marked improvement in size of the previously noted pelvic collection. There is now a right transgluteal pelvic catheter with its tip in the right hemipelvis in the region of the previously seen largest fluid pocket. Several residual small fluid collections are seen in the anterior and posterior aspect of the pelvis. There is an anterior fluid collection demonstrating a thick peripheral wall that measures 3.5 x 3.3 x 2.4 cm. There is a more posterior fluid collection between the uterus and the rectum that measures 2.5 x 3.2 cm. There is a somewhat more narrow tubular-shaped fluid collection in the right hemipelvis extending superiorly from the region of the catheter tip that measures approximately 5 cm in craniocaudal dimension and 1.8 cm in transverse x 1.9 cm in AP dimension. There is extensive phlegmonous stranding and infiltration of the soft tissues adjacent to the percutaneous drain, likely involving the uterus and adnexal regions which are poorly visualized. The terminal ileum is not fully distended but appears to be grossly unremarkable.  **BONE WINDOWS:** No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are identified. There is sclerosis and mild erosive changes of the left sacroiliac joint that are unchanged since the prior examination. Bilateral L5 spondylolysis without evidence of spondylolisthesis."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows significant improvement in the size of the previously noted pelvic collection, with a right transgluteal pelvic catheter in place. However, there are still several residual small fluid collections in the pelvis, including an anterior fluid collection with a thick peripheral wall and a more posterior fluid collection between the uterus and the rectum. The terminal ileum appears to be grossly unremarkable. Given these findings, I need to consider the possibility of a persistent or recurrent abscess, as well as the potential for ongoing bowel infection or inflammation.
Lab Interpretation: {

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination reveals abdominal tenderness, particularly at the site of the drain, with no rebound tenderness or guarding. The presence of tenderness to palpation at the drain site suggests that the patient may still have an ongoing infectious or inflammatory process. Given the patient's history, laboratory results, imaging studies, and physical examination findings, I can now formulate a diagnosis and treatment plan.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Recurrent or persistent periappendiceal abscess
2. Ongoing bowel infection or inflammation
3. Intra-abdominal abscess
4. Small bowel obstruction
5. Ileitis

Treatment: The patient should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, to cover for potential bacterial infection. The patient's drain should be monitored for output and the patient should be followed up with serial imaging studies to assess for resolution of the abscess. The patient should also be kept NPO (nil per os) and hydrated with IV fluids until the abscess has resolved and the patient is able to tolerate oral intake. Surgical consultation should be considered if the patient's condition does not improve with antibiotic therapy and drainage, or if there are signs of complications such as bowel obstruction or perforation.
