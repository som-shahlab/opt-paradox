The patient is a ___ male type I diabetic who, about 1 day ago, began having vague mid-abdominal pain of a colicky nature. He was standing on the T platform and had an episode of clear non-bilious non-bloody emesis. He had 2 loose BMs. He continued to feel unwell and his pain persisted. Thinking that  he might be going into ketoacidosis, he came to the ___ ED to be evaluated.    Past Medical History: 1. Type I diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled. Last HbA1c 10.8   ___. Followed by Dr. ___ at ___. Complicated by   gastroparesis, nephropathy.   2. Erosive gastritis per EGD ___. Noncompliant with GI follow   up for EGD after ___ hospitalization/elopement. Noncompliant   with PPI.   3. Hypertension, uncontrolled   4. Chronic renal insufficiency, baseline 1.5   5. Gastroesophageal reflux disease   6.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient is a male with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled, and complications such as gastroparesis and nephropathy. He presents with mid-abdominal pain, emesis, and loose bowel movements, which could be related to his diabetes or other gastrointestinal issues. Given his history of noncompliance with medication and follow-up, it's essential to consider the possibility of ketoacidosis, gastrointestinal obstruction, or other complications.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show elevated white blood cell count, indicating a possible infection or inflammation. The basic metabolic panel reveals hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and elevated creatinine levels, suggesting renal impairment. The arterial blood gas shows a slightly acidic pH with a low bicarbonate level, indicating metabolic acidosis. The urinalysis reveals significant proteinuria, hematuria, and ketonuria, which could be related to diabetic nephropathy and ketoacidosis. The lipase and amylase levels are slightly elevated, which may indicate pancreatitis.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Ultrasound,\" is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. However, the \"Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan\" matches the requested imaging. Here is the full report for the CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST:  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST (CT): TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial imaging was performed through the abdomen and pelvis after administration of oral contrast only. The patient was only able to tolerate a small amount of oral contrast. No IV contrast was administered due to acute renal failure. Multiplanar reformatted images were then obtained. CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The lung bases appear clear. Lower density of the blood within the heart compared to the myocardium suggests underlying anemia. The nonenhanced liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and ureters appear unremarkable. The abdominal aorta maintains normal caliber throughout. No lymph node enlargement is seen meeting CT size criteria for adenopathy. The orally administered contrast has progressed to the mid ileum. The stomach, small bowel, and colon appear normal. Note is made of high-density material within the base of the appendix as well as more distally within the appendix. While high-density material was previously seen within the appendix, thought to represent fecalith or retained oral contrast, there is new wall thickening of the appendix, dilatation to 11 mm, with mild stranding of the surrounding fat surrounding. Findings suggest uncomplicated early ____. No free air or free fluid is noted within the abdomen. CT PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, seminal vesicles, and the non-enhanced rectosigmoid colon and pelvic loops of small bowel are unremarkable. The prostate is enlarged, measuring 4.9 cm in transverse dimension. Phleboliths are seen within the pelvis. No pelvic free fluid or adenopathy is noted. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Relative lucency along the right posterior iliac bone, along the sacroiliac joint appears little changed compared to CT studies dating back to ___."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's abdominal CT scan without contrast shows an uncomplicated early appendicitis, with wall thickening, dilatation, and surrounding fat stranding of the appendix. The scan also reveals an enlarged prostate and phleboliths in the pelvis. The absence of free air or free fluid in the abdomen is a good sign. However, the patient's renal impairment and metabolic acidosis, as indicated by the laboratory results, need to be addressed. The patient's type 1 diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled, and complications such as gastroparesis and nephropathy, also require consideration in the treatment plan.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Diabetic ketoacidosis
3. Renal impairment
4. Gastroparesis

The patient's renal impairment and gastroparesis should be monitored and treated accordingly. The patient should also be educated on the importance of controlling their diabetes and complying with their medication regimen.
