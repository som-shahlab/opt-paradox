HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ presentes to the ED w/ abdominal pain. The patient states  that she had an acute episode of abdominal pain approximately 2  weeks ago that subsequently resolved. The patient saw her PCP  and was diagnosed with viral gastroenteritis and was sent home.  This subsequently resolved. Today she states that she has had moderate pain in the RLQ and fevers for approximately 2  days. She has had normal bowel movements, no hematochezia or  melena.     Past Medical History: Past Medical History: None   Past Surgical History: None     Social History: ___ Family History: Noncontributory. No GI malignancies


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, specifically in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), accompanied by fevers. This combination of symptoms, particularly the location of the pain, raises suspicion for appendicitis, given the patient's previous episode of abdominal pain that resolved and the current recurrence with fever. The absence of hematochezia, melena, or changes in bowel movements is noted, but these are not exclusive to appendicitis. The patient's history of a recent episode of viral gastroenteritis, which was diagnosed by her PCP, could be relevant but does not directly explain the current symptoms of RLQ pain and fever.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (22.1 K/uL) with a predominance of neutrophils (86.0%), indicating an inflammatory or infectious process. The rest of the CBC parameters are within normal limits. The electrolyte panel is largely unremarkable. The urinalysis shows a few bacteria and some leukocytes, which could suggest a urinary tract infection, but the presence of fever and RLQ pain still points towards appendicitis or another intra-abdominal process. The absence of specific results for amylase, lipase, LFTs, ESR, and CRP limits the ability to fully assess for other causes of abdominal pain such as pancreatitis or liver disease.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis after administration of 130 cc of IV Omnipaque contrast. Axial images were interpreted in conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.  **FINDINGS:**  - The visualized heart is normal.  - Lung bases are clear.  - The pericardium and pleura are intact without effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  - The liver is normal without focal or diffuse abnormality.  - The gallbladder, intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts, pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal.  - The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly.  - The ureters are normal in course and caliber.  - The stomach is normal.  - Large inflammatory collection centered in the right lower quadrant, approximately 6.4 x 4.0 cm, likely representing perforated ____ with abscess formation.  - Inflammation of the adjacent colon and terminal ileum is likely reactive.  - No pneumoperitoneum.  - Small amount of adjacent low density free pelvic fluid.  - No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  - The portal and intra-abdominal systemic vasculature are normal.  - No abdominal wall hernia.  **PELVIS:**  - The bladder and terminal ureters are normal.  - The uterus is unremarkable.  - The right ovary is not well visualized.  - The left ovary appears normal.  - No pelvic side-wall or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  - No inguinal hernia.  **OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:**  - No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion concerning for malignancy."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan with contrast shows a large inflammatory collection in the right lower quadrant, approximately 6.4 x 4.0 cm, likely representing a perforated appendix with abscess formation. This finding, combined with the patient's symptoms of RLQ pain and fever, strongly supports the diagnosis of appendicitis with a complication of abscess formation. The presence of inflammation of the adjacent colon and terminal ileum is likely reactive to the appendicitis. The absence of pneumoperitoneum suggests that the perforation may be contained, but the presence of a small amount of free pelvic fluid indicates some degree of leakage.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination confirms tenderness in the right lower quadrant, which is consistent with the diagnosis of appendicitis. The absence of guarding or rebound tenderness may suggest that the inflammation is localized, but the presence of a fever and elevated white blood cell count indicates an infectious process.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis with abscess formation
2. Perforated appendix
