HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She reports having a stomachache starting the evening of ___. She awoke yesterday, feeling nauseated. She later had a few episodes of non-bilious emesis. She did not eat yesterday due to decreased appetite. She denies fevers or chills. She has been having regular BM's. She denies melena or hematochezia. She denies dysuria or hematuria. She has never had pain like this before. Her pain was initially diffuse, but eventually migrated to her lower abdomen. The pain is crampy in nature. She rates it as a ___ at its worst, however it has decreased to ___ after receiving IV morphine. She has also received Levo/Flagyl in the ED.     Past Medical History: PMH: None  PSH: None    Social History: ___ Family History: Father with alcoholism. Mother with DM.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are non-specific symptoms that can be associated with various conditions. The fact that the pain initially started as diffuse and then migrated to the lower abdomen, and is described as crampy, suggests a possible obstruction or inflammatory process. The patient's denial of fevers, chills, and other systemic symptoms is notable. Given the patient's symptoms and the lack of significant past medical history, it is essential to consider common causes of abdominal pain in adults, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, and intestinal obstruction. Laboratory tests and imaging studies will be crucial in narrowing down the differential diagnosis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. The basic metabolic panel and liver function tests are largely within normal limits, which suggests that the patient's abdominal pain is unlikely due to a metabolic or hepatic cause. The lipase level is within normal limits, making pancreatitis less likely. The urinalysis results do not indicate a urinary tract infection. Given these results, it is essential to consider other possible causes of abdominal pain, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or intestinal obstruction. Imaging studies, particularly abdominal imaging, would be helpful in further evaluating the patient's condition.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report for that study:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT): TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the symphysis pubis with the administration of IV and oral contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were obtained. CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Visualized lung bases are clear. There is no pleural effusion. Visualized lung parenchyma is unremarkable. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. There is a fluid-filled and dilated appendix, with the appendix measuring up to approximately 1.2 cm in maximal ___ with an 8-mm appendicolith present at the orifice of the appendix. Mild inflammatory stranding is seen within the right lower quadrant. These findings are compatible with an acute ____. There is no evidence for perforation or abscess. Minimal equivocal small bowel wall thickening near the tip of the appendix may be secondary reactive changes. Otherwise, the stomach, small bowel, and colon are unremarkable. There is no free air, free fluid, or pathologic adenopathy. CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, rectum, and uterus are unremarkable. Trace amount of pelvic free fluid is likely physiologic. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy. OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified."

AIMessage:
Thought: The abdominal computed tomography scan with contrast shows a fluid-filled and dilated appendix with an appendicolith, consistent with acute appendicitis. The presence of mild inflammatory stranding in the right lower quadrant and minimal small bowel wall thickening near the tip of the appendix supports this diagnosis. The absence of free air, free fluid, or pathologic adenopathy suggests that there is no perforation or abscess. Given these imaging findings, along with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, acute appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis.

Thought: The patient's physical examination results are consistent with acute appendicitis, as evidenced by tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, particularly at McBurney's point.
