Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ s/p lap hiatal hernia repair with Hill gastropexy on ___ which was complicated by peritonitis for which she underwent a negative ex-lap on ___. She was noted to have cholangitis and then underwent ERCP with stone extraction and placement of a stent in the left hepatic duct. Her course was complicated by Ecoli bacteremia for which she was discharged on ___ with a course of linezolid and ultimately changed to CTX which she has since completed. She presents to the ED today with a one day history of sudden onset diffuse abdominal pain as well as nausea and multiple episodes of NBNB emesis. She denies  fevers or chills. She is having bowel movements and has diarrhea at her baseline in the setting of lymphocytic colitis for which she was recently started on a steroid taper by her GI doctor. Her  nursing home reportedly checked a c.diff 3 days ago which was negative.     Past Medical History: ___ esophagus Paraesophageal hernia with ___ erosions lymphocytic colitis- 6+ years Anemia depression hypertension,  history of spinal stenosis- s/p 8 surgeries hypothyroidism osteopenia ETOH use Tobacco abuse ___ x ___ years lumbar and cervical stenosis breast carcinoma s/p right mastectomy ___ s/p EUA, D&C and hysteroscopy ___ s/p  multiple surgeries for chronic back pain, (fusion L1-3, ___ s/p kissing iliac stents, ___ s/p ERCP sphincterotomy s/p Achilles tendon lengthening,  s/p appendectomy   s/p D&C    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother: CVA Father: CAD Siblings: sister died CVA, sister breast cancer, sister


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with sudden onset diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and multiple episodes of non-bilious non-bloody (NBNB) emesis. Given her complex medical history, including recent laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair, ERCP with stone extraction, and placement of a stent in the left hepatic duct, it is essential to consider potential complications related to these procedures. The patient's denial of fevers or chills and the absence of positive C.diff test results reduce the likelihood of an infectious cause, such as Clostridioides difficile infection. However, the patient's history of lymphocytic colitis and recent initiation of a steroid taper may also be relevant. To further evaluate the patient's condition, laboratory tests and imaging studies are necessary.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show an elevated white blood cell count (30.0 K/uL) with a left shift (neutrophils 93.8%), indicating a potential infectious or inflammatory process. The liver function tests reveal mildly elevated AST (52.0 IU/L) and alkaline phosphatase (87.0 IU/L) levels, which may be related to the patient's recent ERCP procedure or other underlying liver conditions. The lipase level is within normal limits (14.0 IU/L), making acute pancreatitis less likely. To further evaluate the patient's condition, imaging studies are necessary to assess for potential complications related to the recent surgical procedures or other abdominal pathologies.

Action Input: Abdominal CT scan with contrast, Chest X-ray

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were prepared.  **CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:** Minimal atelectasis is identified at the lung bases. The imaged cardiac apex is within normal limits. The liver demonstrates homogeneous parenchymal enhancement without discrete lesion. The hepatic veins and portal venous system are grossly patent. The patient is status post recent ERCP with biliary stent placement in the common bile duct. The stent appears in expected position with extension of the proximal limb into the left intrahepatic duct. A tiny focus of central pneumobilia is likely related to recent procedure (5:18). Mild prominence of the central intrahepatic ducts remains. The gallbladder is markedly distended and has surrounding stranding/fluid and wall edema. In the setting of abdominal pain and leukocytosis, ____ is within the differential, however, followup ultrasound is recommended. The spleen and adrenal glands appear within normal limits. The pancreatic parenchyma appears normal. There is mild prominence of the pancreatic duct throughout its course, unchanged compared to prior examination. This could be evaluated by ___ non-emergently if clinically indicated. There is symmetric enhancement of the kidneys without suspicious focal lesion or hydronephrosis. Numerous subcentimeter hypodensities within both kidneys remain too small to characterize, though likely represent small cysts. Abdominal aorta and branch vessels demonstrate severe atherosclerotic calcifications, though are non-aneurysmal and grossly patent. Bi-iliac stent grafts are in expected position and are patent. The patient is status post recent ___ fundoplication secondary to a hiatal hernia. Post-surgical changes near the gastroesophageal junction appear within normal limits. No recurrent hiatal hernia is evident. Small bowel is normal without signs of obstruction or inflammation. No extraluminal free air is identified.  **CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:** Rectum and colon are normal in caliber and configuration without evidence of obstruction or inflammation. The bladder contains a Foley catheter and a small amount of air. Uterus and adnexa are unremarkable. No pelvic fluid is identified.  **BONES AND SOFT TISSUE:** Small foci of air along the anterior abdominal wall are likely secondary to recent injections. Post-surgical appearance of the thoracolumbar spine is overall unchanged in compared to prior examination. No acute fracture or bone destructive lesion is identified."

Thought: The patient's abdominal CT scan with contrast reveals a markedly distended gallbladder with surrounding stranding, fluid, and wall edema, which may indicate acute cholecystitis. The presence of a biliary stent in the common bile duct and the patient's recent ERCP procedure may be related to the development of cholecystitis. The CT scan also shows severe atherosclerotic calcifications in the abdominal aorta and branch vessels, but no evidence of aneurysm or obstruction. The post-surgical changes near the gastroesophageal junction appear within normal limits, and there is no evidence of recurrent hiatal hernia. To further evaluate the patient's condition and guide management, additional laboratory tests and potentially an ultrasound of the gallbladder are necessary.

Thought: The patient's laboratory results and imaging studies suggest acute cholecystitis, which is a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention. The presence of a biliary stent in the common bile duct and the patient's recent ERCP procedure may be related to the development of cholecystitis. The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, are consistent with this diagnosis. Given the patient's complex medical history and recent surgical procedures, it is essential to consider potential complications and develop a comprehensive treatment plan.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute cholecystitis
2. Biliary stent-related complications
3. Post-ERCP pancreatitis
4. Sepsis
5. Intra-abdominal abscess

Treatment: The patient should be admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. The treatment plan should include:
* Broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential bacterial infections
* Pain management with analgesics and anti-emetics
* Fluid resuscitation to prevent dehydration
* Monitoring of vital signs and laboratory results
* Consideration of urgent surgical consultation for potential cholecystectomy
* Follow-up imaging studies to assess the patient's response to treatment and potential complications

Note: The patient's treatment plan should be individualized based on their specific medical history, laboratory results, and imaging studies. A multidisciplinary approach, including surgery, gastroenterology, and infectious disease specialists, may be necessary to optimize the patient's care.
