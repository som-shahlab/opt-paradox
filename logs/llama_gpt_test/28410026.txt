HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ F w/ 48 hrs of lower abd pain. Pain started ___, initially ___ umbilical then migrating to RL and LLQ. Pain is sharp, continuous, associated with nausea and vomiting, nonradiating. First episode. No fevers or chills. Passing flatus but no BM today.     Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with lower abdominal pain that started near the umbilical area and migrated to the right and left lower quadrants, which is a classic symptom of appendicitis. The pain is sharp, continuous, and associated with nausea and vomiting, which further supports this diagnosis. The absence of fever or chills does not rule out appendicitis, as not all patients present with these symptoms. The patient's inability to pass a bowel movement today could be related to the underlying condition causing the abdominal pain. To further evaluate the patient, laboratory tests and imaging studies are necessary.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a elevated white blood cell count (14.7 K/uL) with a high percentage of neutrophils (91.8%), which suggests an acute inflammatory process. The urinalysis results show a few bacteria and some leukocytes, but the presence of bacteria could be a contaminant. The basic metabolic panel is relatively normal. To further evaluate the patient's condition, imaging studies are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for the study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT axial images were acquired from the lung bases through the lesser trochanters following administration of both oral and intravenous contrast material. Multiplanar reformations were performed.  **ABDOMEN CT:** Aside from minimal bilateral dependent atelectasis, right greater than left, the visualized portions of the lungs are clear. A 4-mm hypodensity in the left hepatic lobe is too small to characterize but may be a simple cyst. Additional tiny hepatic hypodensities measuring up to 7 mm (2:27,34) are too small to characterize but are not definitely simple cysts given their irregular contours. The liver is otherwise unremarkable, without evidence of intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The portal vein is patent. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. The stomach is grossly normal. The small bowel and colon are unremarkable, without evidence of obstruction. The appendix is fluid filled and dilated to 9 mm (2:51). There is marked periappendiceal fat stranding without evidence of a fluid collection or free air to suggest perforation. A small quantity of free fluid is seen within the right lower abdominal quadrant. There are no pathologically enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber and its main branches are patent.  **PELVIS CT:** The bladder is grossly unremarkable. The uterus and adnexa are within normal limits. There is a small quantity of free fluid layering in the dependent portion of the pelvis. No pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes are seen.  **BONE WINDOW:** No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified. Multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are noted."
