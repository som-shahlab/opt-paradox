No other complaints.        Past Medical History: Microscopic hematuria:   - CT Abd ___ negative for nephrolithiasis and mass.   - Cystoscopy ___: Marked area of erythema and edema.   - Cytology ___ and ___: Negative for malignant cells   Cystitis (recurrent infections but mostly negative cultures) HTN   HLD   Chronic lower back pain  s/p lumbar discectomies TAH   Social History: ___ Family History: No family hx of kidney stones, no family hx of IBD


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with crampy, spasmodic right flank and right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, which is always present but comes in waves. The pain is accompanied by intermittent chills, but no nausea, vomiting, dysuria, or urinary symptoms. The patient has a history of microhematuria, recurrent UTIs, and chronic back pain. The initial labs show a low hemoglobin level (Hgb 10.2), a low white blood cell count (WBC 3.9), and an elevated lipase level (148). Imaging results are not fully provided, but the patient received antibiotics (IV cipro and flagyl) and pain management (IV morphine and ketorolac). The physical exam is notable for moderate RLQ tenderness to palpation (TTP) without peritoneal signs and a positive right costovertebral angle tenderness (CVAT).

    "Hgb": {"value": 10.2, "interpretation": "low"},
    "WBC": {"value": 3.9, "interpretation": "low"},

"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABDOMEN PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABDOMEN PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST**  **TECHNIQUE:** CTU: Multidetector CT of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired prior to and after intravenous contrast administration with the patient in prone position. The non-contrast scan was done with low radiation dose technique. The contrast scan was performed with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** DLP: 1266.51 mgy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** A right lung base pulmonary cyst is unchanged compared to the prior study. Otherwise, the visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. The previously described hydroureteronephrosis on the left has resolved. There is no nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis. There is no hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions. There is no evidence of urothelial lesions. The distal ureters and bladder are unremarkable.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** In the deep pelvis, there is wall thickening and tethering from the rectosigmoid to sigmoid colon (4:63), with surrounding inflammatory fat stranding, slightly more prominent compared to the prior study from ___, although similar in overall configuration. Mild sigmoid diverticulosis is again noted. There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis. The appendix is unremarkable. Stomach and small bowel loops are normal in size and morphology.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The uterus not visualized. No adnexal abnormalities.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Minimal atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Degenerative changes are most extensive at L4-5 and L5-S1 with disc height loss and endplate sclerosis which has progressed since ___. L5 laminectomy changes are again noted.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

Thought: The patient's abdominal CT with contrast shows wall thickening and tethering from the rectosigmoid to sigmoid colon with surrounding inflammatory fat stranding, which is slightly more prominent compared to the prior study. This suggests a possible inflammatory process, such as diverticulitis. The patient's history of recurrent UTIs and microhematuria, as well as the presence of right costovertebral angle tenderness, also suggests a possible urinary tract issue. However, the CT scan does not show any evidence of nephrolithiasis, ureterolithiasis, or hydronephrosis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination shows mild suprapubic tenderness and tenderness on the right side, as well as costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness. This suggests a possible urinary tract issue, such as pyelonephritis or a kidney stone. The patient's history of recurrent UTIs and microhematuria also supports this diagnosis. The presence of wall thickening and tethering from the rectosigmoid to sigmoid colon with surrounding inflammatory fat stranding on the CT scan suggests a possible inflammatory process, such as diverticulitis. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not strongly suggest diverticulitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Pyelonephritis
2. Kidney stone
3. Diverticulitis
4. Urinary tract infection
5. Inflammatory bowel disease

Treatment: The patient should be treated with antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, for a possible urinary tract infection or pyelonephritis. The patient should also be hydrated with intravenous fluids and monitored for any signs of sepsis or worsening symptoms. If the patient's symptoms do not improve with antibiotic treatment, further evaluation and treatment for other possible diagnoses, such as diverticulitis or inflammatory bowel disease, may be necessary. Pain management with medications such as morphine or ketorolac may also be necessary to control the patient's symptoms.
