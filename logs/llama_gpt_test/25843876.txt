HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ M complaining of dull, diffuse, crampy abdominal and non bloody diarrhea since ___ (4 days ago) in the RLQ. For the  past 2 days it has become sharper and worse in quality, with  radiation to RLQ. He denies nausea, but has had anorexia since ___ and is also complaining of aches in his buttocks and thigh.  No emesis, dyuria, or urinary frequency. His last BM was on ___. He has no history of prior abdominal surgery.    Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient is presenting with symptoms of abdominal pain, non-bloody diarrhea, and anorexia, which have worsened over the past 4 days. The pain has become sharper and is radiating to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), suggesting a possible inflammatory or obstructive process. The absence of nausea, emesis, dysuria, and urinary frequency helps to narrow down the differential diagnosis. The patient's past medical history is unremarkable, and there is no history of prior abdominal surgery. Given the acute onset and progression of symptoms, it is essential to investigate further to determine the underlying cause.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a relatively normal complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests. The lipase level is within normal limits, which makes acute pancreatitis less likely. The urinalysis results are mostly unremarkable, with the presence of some hyaline casts and a small number of red and white blood cells. However, the clinical presentation of the patient, particularly the sharp abdominal pain radiating to the right lower quadrant, suggests that further evaluation is needed to rule out other possible causes such as appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or other gastrointestinal pathogens.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Ultrasound,\" is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. However, the \"Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan\" matches the requested imaging. Here is the full report for the CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis with administration of 130 cc of IV Omnipaque contrast. Axial images were interpreted in conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.  **FINDINGS:**  - The visualized portion of heart is unremarkable. - Bibasilar atelectasis is present. - No pericardial or pleural effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  - Four well-defined hypodense lesions are present in the liver, the two largest of which measure 1.9 cm in hepatic segment II and 2.9 cm in hepatic segment VI. These lesions are most compatible with simple hepatic cysts. - The gallbladder, intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts, and pancreas are normal. - Two hypodense splenic lesions are present. The superior hypodensity (2:24) is peripherally-based and may represent a prior splenic infarction. The inferior hypodensity measures up to 1.2 cm and is also compatible with a benign lesion. - Bilateral adrenal glands are unremarkable. - Subcentimeter renal hypodensities are present, too small to further characterize. The kidneys otherwise enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly. - Bilateral ureters are normal in course and caliber. - The appendix measures up to 13 mm and is fluid filled, contains at least two appendicoliths. Appendix is located in the right mid abdomen, below the cecum, which appears mobile and is reflected upward. There is significant mesenteric stranding around the appendix and a small amount of adjacent low density fluid which does not appear walled-off. - No extraluminal air, walled off collection, or drainable abscess is present. - The stomach is unremarkable. - The small bowel is fluid filled but not distended. There is wall thickening of the terminal ileum, most likely secondary to the adjacent inflammatory process. - The colon is also fluid filled, but not dilated. - No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. - The portal and intra-abdominal systemic vasculature is unremarkable. - No abdominal wall hernia or pneumoperitoneum.  **PELVIS:**  - The bladder and terminal ureters are unremarkable. - The prostate and bilateral seminal vesicles are normal. - Trace free pelvic fluid is present. - No inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy. - No inguinal hernia.  **OSSEOUS STRUCTURES:**  - No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion concerning for malignancy. - Mild multilevel thoracolumbar degenerative changes."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast reveals several important findings. The presence of a fluid-filled appendix with appendicoliths and significant mesenteric stranding around the appendix suggests appendicitis. The wall thickening of the terminal ileum is likely secondary to the adjacent inflammatory process. The presence of simple hepatic cysts and benign-appearing splenic lesions are incidental findings. The clinical presentation of the patient, combined with the imaging findings, strongly suggests acute appendicitis as the primary diagnosis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination reveals tenderness in the right lower quadrant, rebound tenderness, and McBurney's point tenderness, which are all consistent with acute appendicitis. The presence of peritonitis, particularly in the right lower quadrant, further supports this diagnosis. The clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings all point towards acute appendicitis as the primary diagnosis.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Inflammatory Bowel Disease
4. Intestinal Obstruction
5. Mesenteric Lymphadenitis
Treatment: The patient should undergo urgent surgical consultation for possible appendectomy. In the meantime, the patient should be made nil per os (NPO) and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for possible bacterial infection. The patient should also be closely monitored for signs of sepsis or perforation, and fluid resuscitation should be initiated as needed. Post-operatively, the patient should be managed with pain control, wound care, and antibiotics as indicated.
