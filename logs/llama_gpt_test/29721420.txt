HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with history of epigastric  discomfort for many years, always resolving after ___ hours,  not related to eating.  Two days prior to admission, he started having similar epigastric pain  but then developed pain in the RLQ as well, worse with moving  and twisting his body. Does have anorexia and had two episodes of emesis 2 days ago but  none since.  Had frequent bowel movements two days ago as well  but no diarrhea.  The pain waxes and wanes, but he is still  quite tender in the RLQ.  No fever/chills, no dysuria.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: None  Past Surgical History: Wisdom teeth    Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a long history of episodic epigastric discomfort that typically resolves on its own, but this time the pain has migrated to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and is exacerbated by movement. The presence of anorexia, emesis, and frequent bowel movements suggests a possible gastrointestinal issue. The tenderness in the RLQ is concerning for appendicitis, but the absence of fever and chills is notable. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the abdominal pain.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a elevated white blood cell count (18.2 K/uL) with a left shift, indicating a possible infectious or inflammatory process. The basic metabolic panel and liver function tests are largely within normal limits, although the glucose is slightly elevated (101.0 mg/dL). The lipase level is normal (22.0 IU/L), which makes pancreatitis less likely. The absence of fever and chills, combined with the normal lipase level, suggests that the patient's symptoms may be related to another cause. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the abdominal pain.

Action: imaging

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study is an Abdominal Ultrasound, which is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. Therefore, I cannot retrieve and return the full report for an Abdominal Ultrasound."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible gastrointestinal issue, and the elevated white blood cell count indicates a potential infectious or inflammatory process. The normal lipase level makes pancreatitis less likely. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the abdominal pain. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan can help to identify any structural abnormalities or inflammatory processes in the abdomen.
Lab Interpretation: None (no new laboratory values provided)
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT): CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT): CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST**  **TECHNIQUE:** Standard departmental protocol CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with intravenous contrast administration. Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained. TOTAL EXAM DOSE LENGTH PRODUCT: 552.7 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **ABDOMEN:** Visualized lung bases clear. Wedge-shaped hypodensity in the medial left hepatic lobe along the fissure for the falciform ligament most likely represents focal fatty infiltration. Normal-appearing gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands, and kidneys. Normal caliber abdominal aorta. No evidence of lymphadenopathy. Visualized small bowel unremarkable. No evidence of intraperitoneal free air or free fluid. Incidental note of an atretic celiac axis with large superior mesenteric artery supplying the celiac and SMA territory.  **PELVIS:** Normal-appearing urinary bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles. No evidence of significant inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymphadenopathy. Stool in the rectum. In the right lower quadrant, the appendix is enlarged and fluid-filled, measuring 11 mm in diameter, with significant surrounding inflammatory fat stranding, and increased mucosal enhancement. No evidence of surrounding free air or fluid collection or abscess. Findings consistent with acute uncomplicated appendicitis. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable."
