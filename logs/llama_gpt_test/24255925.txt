HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
The patient is a ___ year old man who presents to the ___ ED  with 4 days of Right Lower Quadrant abdominal pain that has not  moved and does not radiate. It is exacerbated by movement with  no notable alleviating factors. He denies fevers, chills,  nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. He reports no prior episodes. He  had a CT scan in ___ that showed a mildly abnormal appendix.    Past Medical History: PSH: knee arthroscopy    Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant abdominal pain that has not moved and does not radiate, exacerbated by movement, which suggests a possible inflammatory or infectious process in the appendix. The patient's history of a CT scan showing a mildly abnormal appendix also points towards a potential issue with the appendix. However, to further evaluate the patient's condition and determine the cause of the abdominal pain, additional information and diagnostic tests are needed.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: Complete Blood Count, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine, Electrolyte Panel, Liver Function Tests, Amylase, Lipase, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, C-Reactive Protein

If you need further information or additional tests, please let me know!"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count, which might suggest that there is no significant infection or inflammation at this point. However, the absence of liver function tests, amylase, lipase, ESR, and CRP results limits the ability to fully assess the patient's condition. To better understand the patient's situation and make a more accurate diagnosis, these missing laboratory tests should be conducted.

ToolMessage:
"Based on the information provided, the results for the requested tests are not available. The laboratory tests listed do not include Liver Function Tests, Amylase, Lipase, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, or C-Reactive Protein. If you need these specific test results, you may need to request them from the laboratory or check if they have been conducted separately."

AIMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant abdominal pain and the previous CT scan showing a mildly abnormal appendix, it is crucial to consider appendicitis as a potential diagnosis. The absence of complete laboratory results, including liver function tests, amylase, lipase, ESR, and CRP, makes it challenging to rule out other conditions. However, the clinical presentation and the need for a definitive diagnosis suggest that imaging studies could provide valuable information.
Lab Interpretation: Not applicable due to lack of new laboratory data.
Lab Interpretation: 
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal CT Scan with Contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT Scan with Contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report:  **Study: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast**  130 cc of Omnipaque intravenous contrast was administered without adverse reaction or complication. Oral contrast was also administered. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also generated.  **Findings:**  **Abdomen:** The visualized portions of the lung bases are clear. The liver shows no focal lesion or intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder shows no stones or wall edema. The spleen is normal size. The pancreas and adrenal glands show no masses or nodules. Kidneys enhance with and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis. The small and large bowel show no evidence of obstruction or wall edema. The appendix is visualized and is prominent in size measuring 9 mm in caliber. It demonstrates equivocal wall edema and minimal surrounding inflammation. A few scattered lymph nodes are present in the right lower quadrant in the mesentery. The overall appearance of this appendix is similar to slightly progressed compared to that on prior exam. There is no organized fluid collection or free fluid. There is no free air.  **Pelvis:** The bladder, prostate and rectum appear unremarkable. There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  **Bones:** There are no aggressive-appearing lytic or sclerotic lesions."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan with contrast shows a prominent appendix with a caliber of 9 mm, equivocal wall edema, and minimal surrounding inflammation. These findings are consistent with appendicitis, especially given the patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant abdominal pain. The presence of a few scattered lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant also supports this diagnosis. Considering the clinical presentation and imaging findings, appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis.
Lab Interpretation: Not applicable due to lack of new laboratory data.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination reveals tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, which is consistent with the diagnosis of appendicitis. The presence of McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, and Psoas sign would further support this diagnosis, but these specific findings are not mentioned in the provided physical examination results. However, the combination of the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings strongly suggests appendicitis as the most likely diagnosis.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric lymphadenitis
3. Gastroenteritis
