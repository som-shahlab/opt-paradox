HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
The patient is a ___ w Crohn's disease s/p SB  resection/ileostomy (___), ileocecectomy (___) and I&D perirectal abscess x 2 (___) now  on Remicade xfer from OSH w epigastric pain x 10 hours, now  resolved. Patient in usual state of health until 1am on day of  presentation when she awoke from sleep w severe, non-radiating  epigastric pain. No associated symptoms - no fever, chills,  nausea or vomiting. No previous episodes of similar pain. Pain was unrelenting prompting presentation to OSH ED where pain  resolved following administration of IV analgesic. Labs at OSH  were within normal limits though CT scan had concern for  cholecystitis as well as R sided colitis. Transferred to ___ for further evaluation and management. Surgery consult  obtained.  On surgery evaluation, patient states that prior pain has  resolved. Otherwise reports that she is well. Tolerating diet.  Passing flatus and daily BM. Denies fever, chills, chest pain,  shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel pattern,  constipation, diarrhea, dietary change, blood per rectum, dysurea. Does endorse intermittent perirectal pain w drainage  from prior fistula tract though this has not bothered her enough  to seek care for it.     Past Medical History: PNC: *) ___ ___ by LMP *) Labs: O+/Ab-/RPRNR/RI/HepBSAg neg/HIV neg/ *) Screening: LR Panorama FFS post placenta ISSUES: - initial tox screen positive for THC, barbituates,  buprenorphine -> neg tox screen since per records - posterior "partial previa" ___ efw 770g 49%  for c/s  POB: G1 ruptured ectopic s/p open salpingectomy (pfannensteal)    Social History: ___ Family History: + for MI in maternal grandfather.  MGM with hypothyroidism and  elevated cholesterol


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease with multiple surgeries, including small bowel resection, ileocecectomy, and incision and drainage of perirectal abscesses. She is currently on Remicade and presents with a resolved episode of severe epigastric pain. The patient's labs were within normal limits, but the CT scan showed concern for cholecystitis and right-sided colitis. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I need to obtain more information about her current state and the results of the CT scan.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated lipase level, which may indicate pancreatitis. The liver function tests are within normal limits, and the hepatitis panel shows a positive result for Hepatitis A Virus Antibody, indicating past infection. The complete blood count and blood chemistry results are also within normal limits. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I need to interpret the laboratory results and consider the patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent episode of epigastric pain.

Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, MRI of the Abdomen

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal Ultrasound,\" is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. However, the available imaging study \"MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC) (MRCP)\" matches the requested \"MRI of the Abdomen.\" Here is the full report for the MRCP:  **MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC) (MRCP):**  **EXAMINATION:** MRCP  **TECHNIQUE:** T1- and T2-weighted multiplanar images of the abdomen were acquired in a 1.5 T magnet. Intravenous contrast: Save mL Gadavist Oral contrast: 1 cc of Gadavist mixed with 50 cc of water was administered for oral contrast.  **FINDINGS:**  - **Lower Thorax:** There is a small right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis.    - **Liver:** There is transient mosaic enhancement of the liver parenchyma which is nonspecific but can be seen in the setting of liver toxicity for example due to medications. There is mild periportal edema. No focal liver lesions. There is trace upper abdominal ascites.    - **Biliary:** Compared to the outside hospital CT of ___ the radiodense stone in the gallbladder neck is now in the gallbladder fundus and the gallbladder is no longer distended. There is mild gallbladder wall edema. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation with the common bile duct measuring 3 mm.    - **Pancreas:** The pancreas is normal in signal and bulk with no peripancreatic stranding.    - **Spleen:** The spleen is normal in size measuring 10 cm.    - **Adrenal Glands:** The adrenal glands are unremarkable.    - **Kidneys:** The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically with no hydronephrosis or masses.    - **Gastrointestinal Tract:** The small and large bowel are normal in caliber with no evidence of obstruction. Although not optimized for visualization of the bowel, there is fluid in transverse mesocolon with hyperenhancing mucosa of the transverse colon suggesting mild transverse colitis. The remainder of the colon is not visualized.    - **Lymph Nodes:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.    - **Vasculature:** The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. Hepatic arterial anatomy is conventional. The portal and hepatic veins are patent.    - **Osseous and Soft Tissue Structures:** Normal bone marrow signal.  **NOTIFICATION:** Change in wet read discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 09:30 on ___ via telephone."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's MRCP results show a small right pleural effusion, bibasilar atelectasis, and transient mosaic enhancement of the liver parenchyma. The gallbladder stone has moved from the neck to the fundus, and the gallbladder is no longer distended. There is mild gallbladder wall edema, but no intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The pancreas is normal, and there is no evidence of obstruction in the small and large bowel. However, there is fluid in the transverse mesocolon with hyperenhancing mucosa of the transverse colon, suggesting mild transverse colitis. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I need to consider the patient's history of Crohn's disease and recent episode of epigastric pain, as well as the laboratory and imaging results.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination results show mild tenderness to palpation in the epigastrium, but no other significant abnormalities. The patient is afebrile, and the vital signs are within normal limits. Considering the patient's history of Crohn's disease, recent episode of epigastric pain, laboratory results, and imaging studies, I can now formulate a diagnosis and treatment plan.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Cholecystitis
2. Pancreatitis
3. Crohn's disease flare
4. Intestinal obstruction
5. Intra-abdominal abscess
Treatment: The patient should be treated with antibiotics for cholecystitis, and her Crohn's disease should be managed with her current medication, Remicade. The patient should also be monitored for any signs of pancreatitis or intestinal obstruction. A follow-up appointment with a gastroenterologist and a surgeon should be scheduled to discuss further management and potential surgical intervention for the gallbladder. The patient's pain should be managed with analgesics, and she should be advised to follow a bland diet and stay hydrated.
