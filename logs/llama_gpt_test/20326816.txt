HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This is a ___ M with hx of bladder ca with recent surgical  intervention who now presents with epigastric pain. Patient was  seen earlier today by Urology for removal of ureteral stent.  Patient then began to experience the epigastric pain shortly  after, which radiates to the back. States it's constant.  endorses nausea but no vomiting. denies black or bloody stools,  diarrhea. No fever or chills.   .   In ED, initial VS were 99.3 67 142/90 20 99% RA. PE showed ttp  in epigastric region, guiac neg. EKG showed sinus rhythm, no ST  changes. Labs were unremarkable except WBC 16.6 and Cr 1.4  (baseline 1.2). Pt had a renal ultrasound which was neg. UA was  dirty however could be contaminant so treatment was not started.  Urine culture was sent. Pt had a contrast study earlier in day,  thus will need to wait for CT abd/pelvis. Pt was given Zofran,  Ativan and Morphine in ED. Also rec'd 3L NS. Pt was then  admitted for continued abd pain. On transfer, VS were Temp -  98.6 oral, HR - 57, BP - 111/72, RR - 16, O2 Sat - 96% room air.    .   On the floor, pt is sleeping comfortably in bed. Awakes to  voice. When asked about pain, states he has ___ epigastric  pain. States was nauseous and vomiting earlier on the floor, now  better with meds. Emesis was nonbloody.   . Review of Systems:   (+) Per HPI   (-) endorses night sweats, recent weight loss. Denies blurry  vision, diplopia, loss of vision, photophobia. Denies headache,  sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies chest pain or  tightness, palpitations, lower extremity edema. Denies cough,  shortness of breath, or wheezes. endorses nausea, vomiting,  denies diarrhea, endorses constipation, denies abdominal pain,  melena, hematemesis, hematochezia. Denies dysuria, hematuria,  stool or urine incontinence. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.  Denies rashes or skin breakdown. No numbness/tingling in  extremities. All other systems negative.      Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:   Pt had epigastric discomfort for ___ years. He lost 30 lbs in the  past ___ years and then another 15 lbs in past 2 months. He became  very fatigue at the end of ___. His WBC was 25,000 on  ___. He was sent to ___ and CT A/P on  ___ showed wall thickening of sigmoid colon and wall  thickening/possible nodular mass involving the bladder that is  adjacent to this area of the sigmoid colon. MRI abd/pelvis on  ___ showed marked thickening and soft tissue signal  involving the sigmoid colon, measuring 8.3x5.0cm. A 0.6cm  necrotic LN in the sigmoid mesentery was also noted. The lesion  extends to left side of the bladder which demonstrated lobulated  lesion measuring 6.8x5.4cm. MRI also showed a large 8.2x6.5cm  lesion in the left hepatic lobe, somewhat wedge-shaped. There  appears to be a nonenhancing portal vein branch in this region,  suspicious for thrombosed vessel. Per MRI report, this is most  likely a perfusion abnormality from underlying thrombosed portal  vein branch, but underlying tumor/tumor thrombus can not  entirely be excluded. He had EGD/colonoscopy on ___ which  showed gastritis, duodenitis and 2 colon polyps. It also showed  sigmoid diverticulosis with suspicion for an extrinsic process.  Per PCP's note, he had cystoscopy per urologist Dr. ___  ___, which showed a 5cm mass in the bladder with surrounding  edema suspicious for transitional cell ca.   .   .   PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   TOBACCO DEPENDENCE   VOCAL CORD NODULES   COLONIC POLYP   HELICOBACTER PYLORI INFECTION     Social History: ___ Family History: mother with breast cancer at age ___. maternal grandmother had  ovarian cancer at her late ___. 2 Maternal aunts had breast  cancer. Maternal cousin had ovarian cancer.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient is a male with a history of bladder cancer and recent surgical intervention, presenting with epigastric pain that radiates to the back, nausea, and vomiting. The patient's initial vital signs and physical examination showed tenderness in the epigastric region, and laboratory tests revealed a high white blood cell count (WBC) and slightly elevated creatinine level. A renal ultrasound was negative, and a urine analysis was dirty but potentially contaminated. The patient was given medications for nausea and pain and received intravenous fluids. Given the patient's complex medical history, including bladder cancer and recent surgical intervention, it is essential to consider potential complications or related conditions that could be causing the epigastric pain.

"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT): CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:   TECHNIQUE: Multidetector scanning is performed from the diaphragm through the symphysis during dynamic injection of 130 cc of Optiray. No prior studies are available for comparison. DLP: 903.6 mGy-cm.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear. In segment VII of the liver there is a 1.5-cm lesion which is hypodense and measures 58 Hounsfield units. Emanating from the left portal vein and extending towards the liver capsule there is a tubular hypodense area which may represent a thrombosed portal vein branch. There is some triangularly shaped area of increased perfusion adjacent to it. The gallbladder contains a high-density material possibly vicarious excretion of contrast from prior CT examination. The spleen is normal in size. The pancreas is unremarkable. The duodenal diverticulum is noted. The adrenal glands are normal. The right kidney is unremarkable. In the left kidney there is a mild hydronephrosis and there is lack of excretion of the left kidney. Only the cortex is enhancing. No contrast is seen in the collecting system as it is seen on the right kidney. In the upper pole of the left kidney there is a 0.9 cm hypodense lesion that is too small to characterize. The left ureter is mildly distended and can be followed into the pelvis. There is some fat stranding surrounding it.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: There is massive wall thickening in the sigmoid colon. This is relatively hypodense. In the sigmoid mesentery there is a small collection that measures 2.5 x 2.3 cm and contains air inclusions. It has an enhancing rim and sits superior to the sigmoid colon. A soft tissue extending from the sigmoid colon to the bladder with enhancing fistula tract. Massive wall thickening of the bladder overlying the fistula tract. This measures about 4.0 cm in width and 1.5 cm in depth. There is air in the bladder. The prostate gland is normal in size. The wall thickening in the colon is very eccentric and while the normal lumen of the colon is seen towards the left side of the pelvis the wall thickening extends to the right side and there is oral contrast seen within this area of the wall consistent with a sinus tract. On bone windows, there are no concerning osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesions."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast reveals several significant findings, including a hypodense lesion in the liver, a possible thrombosed portal vein branch, and a high-density material in the gallbladder. The left kidney shows mild hydronephrosis and lack of excretion, with a small hypodense lesion in the upper pole. The sigmoid colon has massive wall thickening, and there is a collection with air inclusions in the sigmoid mesentery. A soft tissue mass extends from the sigmoid colon to the bladder, with an enhancing fistula tract and massive wall thickening of the bladder. Air is present in the bladder, suggesting a possible fistula or perforation.
