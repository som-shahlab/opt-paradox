HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with a history of depression,  PTSD, GSW to chest, presents for evaluation of acute abdominal  pain.   Patient presented 2 weeks ago to the ED with similar, but less  severe pain in the RUQ and epigastrum.  CT ab at that time  showed dilated CBD, but patient left before an US could be  preformed. For the past three days she has experienced sharp  epigastric pain that comes and goes.  Pain came on again  suddenly last night at approx midnight, is continuous and has  worsened.  Pain is severe at ___, sharp, stabbing, band-like  distribution over upper abd, extending to her back.  The pain is  diffuse and was associated with multiple episodes of NBNB emesis  with +nausea.  Worsened by movement.  No diarrhea, last stool  approx 2 days ago, which is her norm.  No fevers, + chills, +  sweats.   Of note, patient reports heavy drinking (~10 beers) on weekend.  History of heavier EtOH in the past. She's never had gallstones  in the past. No new medications. No recent travel.     Past Medical History: PMH: depression, anxiety, gastritis  PSH: GSW to L chest leading to sternotomy, ex-lap    Social History: ___ Family History: Mostly unknown. ___ had diabetes.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, specifically sharp epigastric pain that has worsened over time, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and radiation to the back. The pain is exacerbated by movement, and the patient has a history of heavy alcohol consumption. Given the location and nature of the pain, as well as the patient's history, I suspect that the patient may be experiencing pancreatitis, possibly exacerbated by alcohol use. The previous CT scan showing a dilated common bile duct (CBD) could also suggest a biliary cause, such as choledocholithiasis or cholangitis. However, more information is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show significantly elevated lipase and amylase levels, which are indicative of pancreatitis. The elevated liver enzymes (AST and ALT) could be related to the pancreatitis or possibly a separate issue, such as alcoholic liver disease. The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and previous episodes of abdominal pain also support the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and lab results, I would like to further evaluate the patient's condition with imaging studies.

"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD W&W/O C (CT).\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD W&W/O C (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT axial images were acquired through abdomen prior to and following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. Oral contrast was administered.  **DOSE:** DLP: 520 mGy-cm (abdomen and pelvis). IV Contrast: 130 mL Omnipaque.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** There is a trace left pleural effusion and adjacent atelectasis. Otherwise, the visualized lung bases are clear.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** Thrombosis of the posterior branch of the right portal vein is again seen. No suspicious focal hepatic lesions. The gallbladder is within normal limits, without stones or gallbladder wall thickening.  **PANCREAS:** There is evidence of severe ____ with areas of necrosis in the head/neck of the pancreas (4, 27). There is extensive acute necrotic collections surrounding the pancreas, extending into the transverse colon mesentery (4, 38), along the pancreatic tail, at the splenic hilum and surrounding the left kidney. A small amount of fluid is also seen surrounding the right kidney.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of stones, focal renal lesions, or hydronephrosis. There are no urothelial lesions in the kidneys or ureters. There is no perinephric abnormality.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The visualized large bowel is normal.  **RETROPERITONEUM:** There is no evidence of retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is no calcium burden in the abdominal aorta and great abdominal arteries. Thrombosis of the posterior branch of the right portal vein is again seen. No pseudoaneurysm is identified. The splenic vein and SMV are patent.  **BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:** There is no evidence of worrisome lesions. Abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."
