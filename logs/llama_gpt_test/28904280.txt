Thought: The patient has a history of locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma and is currently undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy. He presents with abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) that started after eating hot dogs for dinner, which is crampy/achy in nature and persistent. The pain progressed after eating cereal with several episodes of non-bloody, bilious emesis. Given the patient's history of pancreatic cancer and the nature of the pain, I need to consider possible causes such as pancreatic obstruction, bile duct obstruction, or chemotherapy-related side effects.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) with a value of 70.0 K/uL, which is consistent with the patient's history of chemotherapy-related side effects. The liver function tests are relatively normal, with slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase. The amylase and lipase levels are within normal limits, which makes acute pancreatitis less likely. However, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting could be related to the bile duct stent or the pancreatic cancer itself.

"The requested imaging study, \"CT Abdomen with IV contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Acquisition sequence: 1) Spiral Acquisition 3.8 s, 50.2 cm; CTDIvol = 12.0 mGy (Body) DLP = 601.1 mGy-cm. 2) Stationary Acquisition 0.6 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 3.3 mGy (Body) DLP = 1.7 mGy-cm. 3) Stationary Acquisition 6.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 33.4 mGy (Body) DLP = 16.7 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 619 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Visualized lung fields are notable for dependent atelectasis. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. Pneumobilia is again noted. Exchanged CBD stent is noted. The gallbladder is distended, as seen on prior however, there is mild stranding surrounding the body and the gallbladder neck which is new. There is no obvious gallbladder wall thickening or hyper enhancement of the adjacent liver parenchyma.  **PANCREAS:** Pancreatic head mass is again seen though its margins are poorly defined. There is upstream pancreatic ductal dilatation and atrophy with abrupt cut off the region the pancreatic neck as seen on prior.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** Left adrenal nodule is again noted. The right adrenal gland is unremarkable.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. Subcentimeter renal hypodensities bilaterally are too small to characterize but likely cysts. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** There is a small hiatal hernia. The stomach is otherwise unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Patient is status post right colectomy. Sigmoid colon is redundant. Diverticulosis is noted without diverticulitis.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** Prostate is significantly enlarged measuring 8 cm TRV.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Extensive atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is bilateral L5 spondylolysis with grade ___ anterolisthesis of L5 on S1. No focal suspicious osseous lesions identified.  **SOFT TISSUES:** Fat containing left inguinal hernia is noted. There is also fat containing umbilical hernia."

The patient's vital signs are stable, and there is no evidence of acute distress. However, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting persist.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Bile duct obstruction

4. Gallbladder obstruction
5. Acute pancreatitis
Treatment: The patient should be started on intravenous fluids and pain management. A bile duct obstruction or pancreatic duct obstruction should be ruled out with further imaging studies or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). If an obstruction is found, it should be treated with stent placement or other interventions. The patient's chemotherapy regimen should be reviewed and adjusted as needed to minimize side effects.
