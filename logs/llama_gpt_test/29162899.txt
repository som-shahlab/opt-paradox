Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms ___ is a ___ year old lady with IBS presenting with one day  of worsening abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, reduced appetite,  subjective fevers and chills. Over the course of ___ her vague  abdominal pain began worsening in the RLQ. She has not eaten  since yesterday, and she has never had pain like this before. No history of abdominal surgery. Poor appetite. Pain  does not radiate. Hurts to walk. Has history of migraines and  headaches as well as depression and anxiety. Takes psych meds  daily, uses adult ASA for headaches. She thinks she may have  taken ASA within the last couple of days.   Past Medical History: Past Medical History: IBS, depression, anorexia nervosa, basal cell carcinoma,  migraines  Past Surgical History: ___ excision    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother with breast cancer, father with prostate cancer, brother  with depression.


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with worsening abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, reduced appetite, subjective fevers, and chills. The pain is localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) and has worsened over time. The patient's history of IBS and use of ASA (aspirin) could be contributing factors, but the acute onset and severity of symptoms suggest a more serious condition. The patient's past medical history, including depression, anorexia nervosa, and migraines, may also be relevant. 

Given the patient's symptoms and history, it is essential to rule out potential causes of acute abdominal pain, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or bowel obstruction. Laboratory tests and imaging studies will be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a elevated white blood cell count (14.0 K/uL) with a high percentage of neutrophils (91.0%), indicating a potential bacterial infection. The basic metabolic panel (BMP) results are largely within normal limits, but the slightly low sodium level (130.0 mEq/L) and elevated anion gap (15.0 mEq/L) may suggest some degree of dehydration or metabolic acidosis. The liver function tests (LFTs) are within normal limits. The urinalysis results show the presence of many bacteria, which could indicate a urinary tract infection (UTI). However, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and subjective fevers and chills suggest a more complex condition.

Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it is essential to further evaluate the cause of the abdominal pain and potential infection. Imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound, may be necessary to visualize the abdominal organs and identify any potential sources of infection or inflammation.

"The requested imaging study is an Abdominal CT scan, which matches the available imaging study: CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT). Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Acquisition sequence:   1) Stationary Acquisition 3.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 14.1 mGy (Body) DLP = 7.0 mGy-cm.   2) Spiral Acquisition 4.6 s, 50.0 cm; CTDIvol = 4.0 mGy (Body) DLP = 200.7 mGy-cm.   Total DLP (Body) = 208 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is unremarkable.

There is hazy increased density and stranding in surrounding fat as well as a small amount of free fluid in the right pelvis.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast shows a dilated appendix with multiple appendicoliths, surrounded by increased density and stranding in the fat, as well as a small amount of free fluid in the right pelvis. These findings are consistent with acute appendicitis, which is a medical emergency that requires prompt surgical intervention. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and subjective fevers and chills are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Given the patient's symptoms and imaging results, it is essential to proceed with surgical consultation and potential appendectomy to prevent further complications, such as perforation or abscess formation.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination results show tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, a positive psoas sign, and no rebound or guarding, which are consistent with acute appendicitis. The presence of a positive psoas sign, which indicates irritation of the psoas muscle by the inflamed appendix, further supports this diagnosis.

Given the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, imaging findings, and physical examination results, it is highly likely that the patient has acute appendicitis. Prompt surgical intervention is necessary to prevent further complications and improve outcomes.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Urinary tract infection (less likely due to the presence of many bacteria in the urinalysis, but not consistent with the patient's symptoms and imaging findings)
3. Diverticulitis (less likely due to the patient's age and lack of other symptoms)
4. Bowel obstruction (less likely due to the lack of other symptoms and imaging findings)
5. Inflammatory bowel disease (less likely due to the patient's symptoms and imaging findings)

Treatment: The patient should be taken to the operating room for an appendectomy as soon as possible. The patient should also be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential bacterial infection. Pain management and hydration should also be prioritized. Post-operatively, the patient should be monitored for any complications and receive follow-up care to ensure a smooth recovery.
