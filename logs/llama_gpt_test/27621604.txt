HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ hx of biliary colic now presents with abdominal pain.  Patient had one episode of biliary colic in ___ and was  referred for surgical evaluation at that time, however, declined  surgery given social circumstances. Since then she had one  additional episode of colic that resolved until ___ night  when she describes increasing crampy right upper quadrant and  epigastric pain radiating to back. Patient reports that she was  seen in ___ and discharged twice since then with pain and  anti-nausea medications with recommendation to follow up with a  surgeon. Last night after discharge from ___ had tortolleni  with cheese and then pain came back accompanied by nausea. She  also felt weak. Denies fevers or chills. No jaundice. No weight  loss. Social situation still insecure but agrees to have surgery  at this time as pain is making her miserable.    Past Medical History: PMH: thyroid ca s/p thyroidectomy, prior SBOs managed conservatively, htn, GERD, osteoporosis, h.pylori, anxiety, dementia, nephrolithiasis, gallstones, hematuria, incidentally noticed side branch IPMN, benign right hepatic duct stricture   PSH: total thyroidectomy, total hysterectomy, ex-lap for bowel obstruction following hysterectomy in ___    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of biliary colic and gallstones, and is now presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, and weakness. The pain is described as crampy and radiates to the back, which suggests a possible gallbladder or biliary tract issue. The patient has a complex medical history, including prior surgeries, hypertension, GERD, osteoporosis, and a history of bowel obstruction. The patient's social situation is insecure, but she is now willing to undergo surgery due to the severity of her symptoms.

Given the patient's history of gallstones and biliary colic, it is likely that her current symptoms are related to her gallbladder or biliary tract. To further evaluate the patient's condition, laboratory tests and imaging studies would be helpful.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, which may indicate an inflammatory response. The liver function tests are mostly within normal limits, with a slight elevation in alkaline phosphatase. The lipase level is within normal limits, which makes acute pancreatitis less likely. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and weakness, combined with her history of gallstones and biliary colic, suggest a possible gallbladder or biliary tract issue.

To further evaluate the patient's condition, imaging studies would be helpful to visualize the gallbladder and biliary tract.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's imaging study, LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN), shows a markedly distended gallbladder with sludge and stones, a stone at the gallbladder neck, and a slightly thickened gallbladder wall. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cholecystitis or gallbladder obstruction. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and weakness, combined with her history of gallstones and biliary colic, support this diagnosis.

Given the patient's diagnosis and symptoms, a treatment plan can be developed.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Cholecystitis
2. Gallbladder obstruction
3. Biliary colic
4. Pancreatitis
5. Hepatic dysfunction

Treatment: The patient should undergo surgical evaluation for a possible cholecystectomy to remove the gallbladder and relieve the obstruction. The patient should also receive pain management and anti-nausea medications to manage her symptoms. Additionally, the patient should be monitored for any signs of infection or other complications. The patient's social situation and history of prior surgeries should be taken into consideration when developing the treatment plan.
