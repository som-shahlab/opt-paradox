Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman with history of gastritis  ___ Aspirin, diverticulosis (upper endoscopy and colonoscopy by  Dr. ___ in ___ normal), HLD and anxiety and recently  admitted in ___ for idiopathic nausea, abdominal pain and  vomitting who is now presenting with 3 days of diarrhea, lower  abdominal pain, and dark-colored stools and being admitted for  GI bleeding work-up.  Per the patient, 3 days ago, she had acute-onset diarrhea with  associated lower abdominal pain that radiated to the lower back.  She also had nausea without vomitting and dizziness that was  worse on standing. While her diarrhea has improved, yesterday  she noticed blood in her stool and this morning stool was darker  than usual, prompting her to come to the ED.  In the ED, her initial vitals were 97.5 91 127/79 18 100% with  an abdominal exam that was notable for mild epigatsrioc  tenderness and LLQ tenderness.  WBC=6.9, H/H=14.1/42.3. She  received dilaudid 1.5 mg for pain, Zofran 4 mg and 1L NS bolus.  Her UA was negative for leukocytes and bacteria. GI was  consulted and recommended admission for evaluation of upper GI  Bleed.  On transfer, vital signs were 98.1, 60, 117/58, 12, 95%RA,  Pain=6  She endorses a 6lb weight loss in ___s a productive  cough and chills 7 days ago which has now resolved. She has a  mild ___ headache and constant lower abdominal pain that is  radiating to the back.  She continues to have dark stools, but  no longer has bright red blood.

Thought: The patient presents with a complex history of gastrointestinal symptoms, including idiopathic nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and GI bleeding. She has a history of gastritis, diverticulosis, hemorrhoids, and peptic ulcer disease (PUD). The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible upper GI bleed, which requires further evaluation. To determine the cause of the GI bleed, it is essential to consider the patient's medical history, physical examination, and laboratory results.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a normal complete blood count (CBC) with a slight elevation in neutrophils, indicating a possible inflammatory response. The electrolyte panel reveals hyperkalemia, which may be due to renal insufficiency or other factors. The liver function tests (LFTs) are mostly within normal limits, except for a slight elevation in aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The lipase level is normal, which makes pancreatitis less likely. The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels are within normal limits, indicating adequate renal function.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Upper GI series,\" is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. However, the requested \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST.\" Here is the full report for that study:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. IV Contrast: 100 mL Omnipaque. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. Oral contrast was not administered.  **DOSE:** This study involved 4 CT acquisition phases with dose indices as follows: 1) CT Localizer Radiograph 2) CT Localizer Radiograph 3) Stationary Acquisition 2.5 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 12.0 mGy (Body) DLP = 6.0 mGy-cm. 4) Spiral Acquisition 4.0 s, 44.0 cm; CTDIvol = 6.5 mGy (Body) DLP = 283.4 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 289 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**  **LOWER CHEST:** There is mild dependent atelectasis bilaterally. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**  **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of suspicious renal lesions or hydronephrosis. 3 mm left upper pole hypodensity (601:36) is too small to characterize. There is no perinephric abnormality.  **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. There is mild pericolonic fat stranding at the junction of the distal descending and proximal sigmoid colon in a region of diverticula concerning for acute ____. No extraluminal gas or focal fluid collection is present. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon is severe. Circumferential wall thickening of the sigmoid colon is likely due to muscular hypertrophy as result of the diverticular disease. The appendix is normal.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is mild free fluid in the pelvis (02:59).  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The uterus is of normal size and enhancement. There is no evidence of adnexal abnormality bilaterally.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. An umbilical hernia containing fat is small."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's abdominal CT scan with contrast shows mild pericolonic fat stranding at the junction of the distal descending and proximal sigmoid colon, which is concerning for acute diverticulitis. The presence of severe diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and circumferential wall thickening of the sigmoid colon likely due to muscular hypertrophy as a result of the diverticular disease supports this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of lower abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dark-colored stools are also consistent with diverticulitis.
