HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with three days of RUQ pain after eating ___ which  started in the RUQ and radiated to the epigastrium. She  initially presented to ___ three days ago where she  had elevated LFTs. Given concern for possible  choledocholithiasis she was transferred to ___. Per patient  report, she was managed non-operatively without intervention at  ___ and was discharged home. At home her RUQ pain returned and  was associated with subjective fevers, chills, nausea, and  vomiting.  She returned to ___ where she was again noted to  have elevated LFTs concerning for choledocholithiasis so was  transferred to ___ for further care.  Overall she is a poor  historian but is moving her bowels regularly. She has limited  herself to a non-fat diet to avoid pain.      Past Medical History: PMH: colitis of unknown etiology, diverticulitis, anxiety, depression  PSH: Tubal ligation, Ear surgery x2    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother had cholecystectomy, ___ with alcoholism


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a history of recurrent right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, elevated liver function tests (LFTs), and symptoms suggestive of a biliary tract disorder, such as choledocholithiasis. The patient's past medical history of colitis and diverticulitis may be relevant, but the primary concern is the potential for a biliary obstruction or other hepatobiliary issue. Given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings, further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of the RUQ pain and elevated LFTs.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show elevated liver function tests, including ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase, which suggest hepatobiliary disease. The elevated bilirubin levels also support this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are consistent with choledocholithiasis or another biliary tract disorder.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, Abdominal Ultrasound or Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), is not available in the provided list. The available imaging study is a LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound)."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results and symptoms suggest a hepatobiliary disorder, and imaging studies are necessary to further evaluate the patient's condition. An abdominal ultrasound or MRCP would be helpful in visualizing the gallbladder, bile ducts, and liver.

Action: imaging
Action Input: Liver or Gallbladder Ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Liver or Gallbladder Ultrasound,\" matches the available imaging study \"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound).\" Here is the full report:  **LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound):**  **FINDINGS:** The liver is homogenous in echotexture without discrete mass or lesion. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Patient's gallbladder is present and multiple mobile gallstones are identified. The gallbladder is not distended nor is there any pericholecystic fluid. On a few provided images, gallbladder wall appears thickened whereas in other images it appears of normal diameter. Occasional thickened appearance is likely related to non-distended state. Common bile duct is not dilated measuring 4 mm. The very distal aspect of the pancreatic tail is excluded from view due to bowel gas; however, the visualized parts are unremarkable. Demonstrated portions of the right kidney, inferior vena cava and aorta are normal. No free fluid identified."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's ultrasound results show multiple mobile gallstones in the gallbladder, which is consistent with choledocholithiasis or cholelithiasis. The gallbladder wall appears thickened in some images, which may indicate chronic inflammation. The common bile duct is not dilated, which suggests that there may not be a significant obstruction. However, the presence of gallstones and elevated liver function tests suggests that the patient may still have a biliary tract disorder.
