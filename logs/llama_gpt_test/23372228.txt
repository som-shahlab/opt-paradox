HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
HPI: ___ with 5 day history of abdominal pain in the RLQ. Pain began 5 days prior to admission, diffusely in the lower abdomen and increased 4 days prior to admission. Pain is intermittent at reaches 9 of 10 in severity. Patient reports that the pain remains unchanged in the past 4 days. It does not radiate and he notes that it is worse when he is walking. He has continued to eat throughout episodes of pain and reports that he last ate a breakfast bar this morning. However, he was not hungry at the time of interview, despite not having eating for the rest of the day. Mr. ___ reports mild diarrhea throughout the past 5 days. He has a history of non-de script GI symptoms including nausea and feeling that his "lips get irritated when I eat bread" and was found to be negative for celiac disease in ___.  Due to the continued pain, Mr. ___ reported to his PCP on the morning of ___ who referred him to the ER.     Past Medical History: Question of irritable bowel syndrome. -Anxiety -Acid Reflux (does not take regular medication for it) -EGD performed in ___.    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a 5-day history of abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), which is intermittent and severe, reaching 9 out of 10 in severity. The pain is worsened by walking and is accompanied by mild diarrhea. The patient's history of non-descript GI symptoms, including nausea and potential gluten intolerance (although celiac disease was ruled out), and past medical history of possible irritable bowel syndrome, anxiety, and acid reflux, are important considerations. Given the location and nature of the pain, along with the associated symptoms, an initial step would be to rule out common causes of RLQ pain such as appendicitis, especially considering the patient's symptoms have not changed significantly over the past 4 days.

If you need further information or additional tests, please let me know!"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's CBC results show a normal white blood cell count, which might suggest that there is no significant infection or inflammation at this point. However, to further evaluate the patient's condition, especially considering the abdominal pain and diarrhea, it would be crucial to obtain the results of the liver function tests, lipase, amylase, ESR, and CRP, as these can provide more insight into potential pancreatic, liver, or inflammatory issues.

ToolMessage:
"The requested tests and their results are as follows:  1. Liver Function Tests: The results for Liver Function Tests are not available in the provided data. 2. Lipase: The results for Lipase are not available in the provided data. 3. Amylase: The results for Amylase are not available in the provided data. 4.

Unfortunately, the requested tests are not included in the available laboratory test results."

AIMessage:
Thought: Given the lack of specific laboratory results for liver function tests, lipase, amylase, ESR, and CRP, it's challenging to narrow down the diagnosis based on laboratory evidence alone. However, considering the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant (RLQ), mild diarrhea, and the fact that the pain worsens with walking, clinical suspicion for conditions such as appendicitis or other inflammatory processes remains. An imaging study could provide valuable information to guide the diagnosis.

Lab Interpretation: None provided
Lab Interpretation: 
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal CT Scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT Scan,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST (CT):**  **TECHNIQUE:** MDCT-acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness. Oral contrast was administered prior to the examination. At the time of study, a total of 130 cc of saline combined with Omnipaque contrast was injected, however, there was infiltration of the IV. The patient was evaluated by the radiology clinical team Dr. ___ Dr. ___ a plastic surgery consult was called at the time of evaluation. Physical exam showed swelling of the proximal right forearm and arm near the IV site compared to the contralateral side. Symmetric pulses and brisk capillary refill was noted and there were no overlying skin changes.  **CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:** The imaged lung bases are clear. No pulmonary nodule or pleural effusion is identified. The imaged cardiac apex is within normal limits. Complete evaluation of the abdominal viscera is limited secondary to the non-contrast technique. However, the liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys appear symmetric without focal lesion. There is minimal excretion of intravenous contrast in the collecting system and no hydronephrosis. The abdominal aorta is non-aneurysmal throughout its course and demonstrates no calcified atherosclerotic plaque. No abdominal free fluid or free air is evident. The stomach and small bowel loops are normal in caliber and configuration without evidence of obstruction or inflammation. The appendix is dilated up to 1.9 cm and is fluid filled. Additionally, there is surrounding periappendiceal fat stranding and an appendicolith within the proximal portion of the appendix (602B:26 and 2:57). No extraluminal free air is identified in the region to suggest microperforation. There is no surrounding free fluid.  **CT PELVIS WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:** The rectum and colon are normal in caliber and configuration without evidence of obstruction or inflammation. Oral contrast reaches the level of the sigmoid colon. The prostate and seminal vesicles are normal. The bladder is mildly distended and appears unremarkable. Scattered phleboliths are seen throughout the pelvis.  **BONES AND SOFT TISSUES:** No bone destructive lesion or acute fracture is identified."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without intravenous contrast shows a dilated appendix with surrounding periappendiceal fat stranding and an appendicolith, which are indicative of appendicitis. The absence of free air or fluid suggests that there is no perforation. Given these findings, along with the patient's clinical presentation of right lower quadrant abdominal pain that worsens with walking, the most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis.

Lab Interpretation: None provided
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Tenderness in the right lower quadrant, McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign

ToolMessage:
"upon admission:  ___:  Vitals: ___ T=98.2; HR=99; BP=112/77; RR=16; O2=100%RA GEN: A&Ox3, NAD. HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R. PULM: CTAB, No W/R/R. ABD: Mild guarding, nondistended, tenderness in RLQ and LLQ,  most tender in RLQ near ___s point. Rovsing's sign neg. Obturator sign neg. Psoas sign positive. +BS.   Physical examination"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination findings, including tenderness in the right lower quadrant, particularly near McBurney's point, and a positive psoas sign, further support the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The presence of mild guarding and the tenderness pattern are consistent with an inflammatory process in the appendix. Given the combination of clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is highly likely.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Irritable Bowel Syndrome
4. Inflammatory Bowel Disease
5. Intestinal Obstruction

Treatment: The patient should undergo urgent surgical consultation for potential appendectomy. Preoperative management should include bowel preparation if possible, administration of intravenous fluids for hydration, and broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover for potential bacterial infection. Postoperative care should focus on pain management, monitoring for signs of infection or complications, and gradual return to normal activities and diet. Follow-up with the surgical team and primary care physician is essential to ensure proper healing and to address any concerns or questions the patient may have.
