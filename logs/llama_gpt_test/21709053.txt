HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Patient is a ___ y/o female who presents to the ED with sudden onset RLQ pain. She was in her usual state of health  until last night at 1am when she awoke with sharp pain, a ___ in severity, in her epigastric area. It migrated to the LLQ and eventually to the RLQ at 8 am. She was unable to sleep last  night due to the pain. She has been able to pass flatus and has had 2 bowel movements since the pain started. She is currently in no pain at rest but states the sharp pain escalates to a ___ upon movement or when palpated. During the car ride to the ED, she noticed that the pain increased with bumps in the road. She has had no nausea or vomiting but also hasn't eaten anything. She  has been able to urinate normally with no pain or burning. She has noticed no blood in her urine or stool. She states she has not had any fever or chills. She had her last menses on ___ and has not noticed any vaginal spotting or discharge.     Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: None


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with sudden onset right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, which initially started in the epigastric area and migrated to the RLQ. This type of pain migration is classic for appendicitis. The pain is sharp and worsens with movement or palpation, which is also consistent with appendicitis. The patient's ability to pass flatus and have bowel movements does not rule out appendicitis. The lack of nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills does not exclude appendicitis either. Given the patient's symptoms, I need to order some laboratory tests to help confirm the diagnosis.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count, which does not necessarily rule out appendicitis. The urinalysis results are relatively normal, which decreases the likelihood of a urinary tract infection. However, the lack of ESR and CRP results limits the interpretation of the patient's inflammatory response. To further evaluate the patient's condition, I need to order imaging studies to visualize the appendix and surrounding structures.
Lab Interpretation: {

Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study is an Abdominal Ultrasound and an Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan. From the available imaging studies, the CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST best matches the requested Abdominal Computed Tomography Scan. Here is the full report for that study:  **Study Name: CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST**  **TECHNIQUE:** Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  **DOSE:** Acquisition sequence:   1) Stationary Acquisition 5.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 36.1 mGy (Body) DLP = 18.1 mGy-cm.   2) Spiral Acquisition 4.7 s, 51.9 cm; CTDIvol = 14.2 mGy (Body) DLP = 737.1 mGy-cm.   Total DLP (Body) = 755 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:**   **LOWER CHEST:** Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  **ABDOMEN:**   **HEPATOBILIARY:** The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.   **PANCREAS:** The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.   **SPLEEN:** The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.   **ADRENALS:** The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.   **URINARY:** The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.   **GASTROINTESTINAL:** The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is mildly enlarged measuring 7-8 mm with slightly thickened walls and mild mucosal hyperenhancement, but no adjacent fat stranding is identified.  **PELVIS:** The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  **REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS:** The uterus and bilateral adnexae are within normal limits.  **LYMPH NODES:** There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  **VASCULAR:** There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  **BONES:** There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  **SOFT TISSUES:** The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan shows a mildly enlarged appendix with thickened walls and mucosal hyperenhancement, but no adjacent fat stranding. This finding is consistent with appendicitis, particularly given the patient's clinical presentation of RLQ pain. However, the absence of significant fat stranding or other signs of complications such as perforation or abscess is notable. To confirm the diagnosis and guide management, I will consider the patient's overall clinical picture, laboratory results, and imaging findings.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical examination results show tenderness to palpation in the RLQ, which is consistent with appendicitis. The presence of McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, and Psoas sign also support the diagnosis of appendicitis. Given the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory results, imaging findings, and physical examination results, I am confident in making a diagnosis and developing a treatment plan.
**Final Diagnosis (ranked):** 
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Urinary tract infection
4. Ovarian torsion
5. Diverticulitis
Treatment: The patient should undergo urgent surgical consultation for possible appendectomy. In the meantime, the patient should be made NPO, and IV fluids should be administered. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started to cover for possible bacterial infection. The patient should be closely monitored for any signs of complications such as perforation or abscess formation. Pain management should be initiated as needed.
