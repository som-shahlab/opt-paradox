HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with no significant PMH who presents with 4 days history of  lower abdominal pain. never happen to him before. pain is  constant, ___ in intensity, no radiation, worst with movement.  Denies N/V/F/C. Last BM was this ___ and it was normal. Last  flatus was at the same time. Pt was seen by his PCP today and  was advised to come to ___ for further evaluation.    Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: unremarkable


AIMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a 4-day history of lower abdominal pain that is constant, worsens with movement, and has no radiation. The patient denies nausea, vomiting, fever, or changes in bowel movements. Given the acute onset and nature of the pain, it is essential to consider possible causes such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or other gastrointestinal issues. The fact that the pain worsens with movement could indicate peritoneal irritation. To further evaluate the patient, laboratory tests and imaging studies would be helpful.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: Complete Blood Count, Blood Urea Nitrogen, Creatinine, Electrolyte Panel, C-Reactive Protein, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, Urinalysis

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a normal white blood cell count, which might suggest that there is no significant infection or inflammation at this point. The urinalysis results are mostly unremarkable, with no evidence of infection or proteinuria. However, the presence of hazy urine could indicate some degree of dehydration or possible urinary tract issues, but without leukocytes or nitrites, a urinary tract infection seems less likely. The electrolyte panel and renal function tests (BUN and creatinine) are within normal limits, indicating no acute kidney injury or significant electrolyte imbalances. Given the clinical presentation of lower abdominal pain, especially with worsening pain upon movement, and the relatively normal laboratory findings, imaging studies would be crucial to further evaluate for possible causes such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or other abdominal pathologies.

Action Input: Abdominal Ultrasound, Abdominal CT scan with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging study, \"Abdominal CT scan with contrast,\" matches the available imaging study \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT).\" Here is the full report:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  **EXAM:** CT of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.  **TECHNIQUE:** 64-row MDCT of the abdomen and pelvis was done with oral and intravenous contrast. Split bolus technique. 150 cc of Omnipaque. Multiplanar reconstructions. DLP: 683 mGy-cm.  **FINDINGS:** The liver is normal in size with no focal mass or diffuse abnormality. There is no bile duct dilatation and the gallbladder is normal. The pancreas is normal in size with no focal mass or diffuse abnormality. There is no peripancreatic stranding. The spleen is not enlarged and appears homogeneous. The adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. The kidneys are normal in size with no focal cortical mass, solid or cystic. There are equal and prompt nephrograms bilaterally. The pelvicalyceal systems and ureters are normal. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph node enlargement or other mass. The stomach and duodenum are normal. The mucosal pattern of the jejunum and ileum is normal with no signs of small bowel dilatation. There is no obstructing lesion in the colon. The appendix is well visualized lateral and inferior to the cecum. It contains air within it. It is of normal caliber with no primary or secondary signs of appendicitis. There is no periappendiceal stranding. In the left lower quadrant anterior to the sigmoid there is an area of stranding with focal encapsulated fat within it with the classic appearance of epiploic appendagitis. In the pelvis there is no abnormal lymph node enlargement or other mass. The prostate is normal in size. The urinary bladder is unremarkable. There is small amount of free fluid in the rectovescical pouch."

AIMessage:
Thought: The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast has provided valuable information. The liver, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon appear normal. The appendix is well-visualized and does not show signs of appendicitis. However, there is an area of stranding with focal encapsulated fat in the left lower quadrant, anterior to the sigmoid, which is consistent with epiploic appendagitis. Epiploic appendagitis is a condition where there is inflammation of the epiploic appendages, which are small, fat-filled structures attached to the colon. This condition can cause abdominal pain, especially in the lower quadrants, and can mimic other conditions such as appendicitis or diverticulitis. Given the patient's symptoms and the imaging findings, epiploic appendagitis is a likely diagnosis.
