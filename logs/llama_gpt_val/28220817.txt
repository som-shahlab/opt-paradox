BMBx ___  showed hypocellular BM negative FISH MDS panel) C1D1 of  ATG/Cyclosporine ___ (DAY 751) c/b by SVT, finished, also completed 2 week serum sickness prophylaxis with prednisone with taper. Initially difficult transfusion as her Solid phase HLA, PRA were 75% and SAG I were 100%. She had minimal to no response to HLA matched PLT, but was able to respond to cross-matched PLTs. Dx Influenza B. ___. Admitted ___ b/l venous stasis with LLE ulcers (vascular, dermatology following)- healing with vinegar soaks, xeroform, sterile gauze, BID dressing change f/u with ___ wound clinic. Follows closely with ___ clinic.    Last IVIG ___ 1258, given ___ Onc medication: Cyclosporine 125 PO BID ___ cyclosporine level PND(with kidney insufficiency/ Hypomagnesemia)   PPX: Acyclovir, fluconazole, Mepron   ___ P/w RLQ pain with no radiation and subjective fevers that's been worsening since ___ with gradual onset.

Pain was initially a soreness, she ate well ___ with normal bowel movements. ___, the soreness became a sharp pain, it was so bad that she was unable to eat anything, still had normal BM. ___, pain became intolerable, no PO intake with normal BM in the AM. No N/V/D/C. Pt presented to clinic with these symptoms and was found to be tachycardic 122 with Tmax 102.8. Pt was given 1L fluid in  clinic, Tylenol and Meropenem and pain, tachycardia and fever improved.  Of note, pt did not take her Coumadin this AM ___ abdominal  pain. INR 2.0.  She also complains of a productive cough with clear/white sputum for 1 week and new throat pain this morning with DOE above her baseline that resolved with rest. Walking O2 stat in clinic was 95%.   Denies SOB at rest. Denies chest pain or palpitations. Denies lightheadedness or dizziness. Here today son.   Past Medical History: PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY (per OMR): ___ yo ___ women with history of multiple VTEs on chronic anti-coagulation was admitted on ___ with melena. In addition to severe anemia CBC revealed severe thrombocytopenia with PLT count less than 15.000 and moderate neutropenia. Her prior CBD from ___ showed only mild normocytic anemia with Hb 10.0. While undergoing evaluation patient was treated for presumptive ITP. She was treated with multiple lines of treatment including prednisone, IVIG,  rituximab and romiplastin without improvement in her platelets count. She underwent several BMBx on ___ and ___.  The  biopsies revealed progressively hypo-cellular marrow with decreased megakaryocytes, the findings most consistent with either hypo-plastic MDS vs aplastic anemia. Because no overt dysplasia was noted the latter was favored.  She had no abnormalities on cytogenetics and negative FISH for MDS panel. She received cycle# 1 of ATG/cyclosporine on ___, first dose of Atgam was complicated by SVT, but subsequently she tolerated remaining doses without significant side effects.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient has a complex medical history, including aplastic anemia, multiple episodes of pulmonary embolism, chronic hepatitis B infection, and a history of recurrent GI bleeding. She is currently experiencing right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain, subjective fevers, and a productive cough. Given her history of GI bleeding and current symptoms, it is essential to rule out any gastrointestinal or abdominal pathology.

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show a low hemoglobin level, indicating anemia, and a low platelet count, which is consistent with her history of aplastic anemia. The liver function tests are relatively normal, but the slightly elevated AST and ALT levels may indicate some liver injury or inflammation. The electrolyte panel and renal function tests are also relatively normal. The INR is slightly elevated, which may be due to her anticoagulation therapy.

ToolMessage:
"The requested imaging studies include an Abdominal CT scan and a Chest CT scan. Both of these imaging studies are available in the provided list. Here are the full reports for each:  **CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):**  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 2,237 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Please refer to separate report of CT chest performed on the same day for description of the thoracic findings.  ABDOMEN:  HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. Two simple cysts in the left kidney measure 1.6 and 2.0 cm, respectively. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: There is a small paraesophageal hernia. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. There is mesenteric fat stranding adjacent to the cecum (8:88), which appears to be centered at a small inflamed diverticulum (8:85). A small focus of air is noted on series 8, image 87, equivocal for microperforation. The cecal wall, terminal ileum, and appendix are normal. The colon and rectum are within normal limits.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Moderate atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits. Multiple varices are noted in the anterior abdominal soft tissues.  NOTIFICATION: The above findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at 20:43 on ___, 5 min after discovery.  **CT CHEST W/CONTRAST (CT):**  EXAMINATION: CT CHEST W/CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was coordinated with intravenous infusion of nonionic iodinated contrast agent reconstructed as contiguous 5- and 1.25-mm thick axial, 2.5-mm thick coronal and parasagittal, and 8 x 8 mm MIPs axial images.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 2,237 mGy-cm. ** Note: This radiation dose report was copied from CLIP ___ (CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST):  FINDINGS:  MEDIASTINUM/HEART: The visualized thyroid is unremarkable. Supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes are not enlarged by CT size criteria. The aorta and main pulmonary artery are normal"

AIMessage:
Thought: The patient's abdominal CT scan shows a small inflamed diverticulum in the cecum with adjacent mesenteric fat stranding, which may be the cause of her right lower quadrant pain. The presence of a small focus of air near the diverticulum raises the possibility of a microperforation. The chest CT scan does not show any significant abnormalities. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a possible diagnosis of diverticulitis, which may have led to a microperforation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Diverticulitis with possible microperforation
2. Aplastic anemia

5. Diabetes mellitus (steroid-induced)

Treatment: The patient should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, to cover for possible bacterial infection. She should also be kept nil per os (NPO) and receive intravenous fluids to manage her symptoms. Pain management with acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be considered. If the patient's condition worsens or if there is evidence of peritonitis, surgical intervention may be necessary. Additionally, the patient's anticoagulation therapy should be managed carefully to prevent further complications.
