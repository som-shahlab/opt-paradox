HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ yo F s/p RnYGBP in ___ presents with one day of  periumbilical/epigastric abdominal pain which has migrated to  the RLQ. This pain was band-like across her abdomen and she  describes it as a burning sensation. Not associated with eating.  Last BM this AM at 8. She was awoken by the pain at 5:00 AM. She  denies n/v/f/c/cp/sob, but the pain has been so severe that she decided  to come in. Denies BRBPR, melena, changes in urinary habits.   Past Medical History: 1. Sleep apnea 2. C-section ___ years prior 3. Kidney stone @ ___ years old   4. BTL ___ years ago 5. L sided back pain x ___ years following epidural    Social History: ___ Family History: FH: Father with kidney cancer s/p resection ___ yr. ago; Mother  deceased MI ___, also DM.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a ___-year-old female with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RnYGBP) presenting with acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical/epigastric to RLQ. This raises concern for appendicitis, even though the initial location is atypical.  Given her history of RnYGBP, other possibilities include internal hernia, small bowel obstruction, or even complications related to the bypass.  I need to gather more information to narrow down the differential diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, obturator sign, psoas sign),  assess for Murphy's sign

ToolMessage:
"98.0 80  118/68  20  100%RA GEN: A&O, NAD   HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist   CV: RRR, No M/G/R   PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R   ABD: Soft, nondistended, TTP in RUQ and RLQ, voluntary guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses    Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical exam reveals tenderness in both the RUQ and RLQ with voluntary guarding, but no rebound tenderness or other peritoneal signs.  The lack of fever and relatively normal vital signs are somewhat reassuring, but do not rule out serious pathology.  Given the atypical presentation and history of RnYGBP, imaging is necessary to further evaluate for appendicitis, internal hernia, or other causes of obstruction.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report from the available imaging. While the report is labeled as \"CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST,\" it includes both abdomen and pelvis sections and matches the requested imaging.  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial MDCT-acquired images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after uneventful administration of oral and 130 cc of intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were reviewed.  CT ABDOMEN: Imaged lung bases are clear. The visualized heart and pericardium are normal. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The liver enhances homogeneously without concerning focal lesion. There is a subcentimeter calcification in the lateral segment of the left hepatic lobe (2:14) is stable since ___, likely representing granuloma. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is normal without gallstones within. The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. Gastric bypass changes with suture lines in the left hemi-abdomen are noted. Oral contrast is seen within the excluded stomach and duodenum/afferent limb, concerning for gastro-gastric fistula, or alternatively reflux proximally through the afferent limb. Loop of small bowel in the left abdomen, near the anastomosis is mildly dilated. Contrast is seen distally and findings may be post-surgical. Small bilateral subcentimeter renal hypodensities are too small to further characterize. There is no hydronephrosis bilaterally. There is no free air or free fluid. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is noted.  PELVIS: The appendix is fluid-filled and dilated measuring up to 9 mm in maximum diameter. There is mild enhancing appendiceal wall thickening with mild adjacent periappendiceal fat stranding. The appendix does not fill with oral contrast. No adjacent fluid collection is noted. The loops of large bowel, sigmoid and rectum are normal. The uterus is enlarged and with fibroids within, similar in appearance from ___. A 3.2 cm left hypodense adnexa lesion is not well characterized in this study and may represent a cyst. The bladder, distal ureters, sigmoiod and rectum are normal. Mild amount of free fluid is noted in the cul-de-sac. No free air is noted. A few prominent ileocolic lymph nodes are noted. The aorta is normal without aneurysm formation or calcified atherosclerosis.  BONE WINDOWS: There are mild multilevel degenerative changes throughout the thoracic and lumbar spine with grade 1 retrolisthesis of L5 over S1. No concerning osseous lesions for infection or malignancy is noted."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan reveals a dilated appendix with wall thickening and periappendiceal fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis.  The findings of a possible gastro-gastric fistula or reflux are noted, but are less likely to be the cause of her acute symptoms. The enlarged uterus with fibroids and adnexal cyst are also noted but are unlikely to explain her current presentation. The mild free fluid in the cul-de-sac further supports the diagnosis of appendicitis.  I have enough information to make a recommendation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Small Bowel Obstruction (partial)
3. Internal Hernia
4. Gastro-gastric fistula
5. Early postoperative changes from RnYGBP

Treatment:  Given the CT findings confirming acute appendicitis, the patient should undergo an appendectomy.  A laparoscopic approach is preferred if feasible.  Given her history of RnYGBP, the surgical approach may need to be modified, and consultation with a surgeon experienced in these procedures is recommended.  The patient should be started on IV fluids, pain medication, and prophylactic antibiotics.  Further evaluation of the gastro-gastric fistula can be pursued after the appendectomy if clinically indicated.  The other incidental findings on the CT scan can be addressed with her primary care physician as needed.
