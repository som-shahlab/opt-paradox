HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with acute onset abd pain x 1 day beginning yesterday  evening. Pain constant and getting worse. Localized to lower  abdomen with radiation to lower right and umbilical this AM. +  nausea, dry heaving but no vomiting. First ever episode. +  anorexia. Denies fevers or chills, dysuria, cp or SOB.    Past Medical History: PMH: none PSH: ing hernia repair as infant, unable to recall    Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributary


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, localized to the lower abdomen with radiation to the lower right and umbilical area, accompanied by nausea, anorexia, and dry heaving. This presentation raises suspicion for appendicitis.  However, other diagnoses such as ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy (if female), or a urologic issue need to be ruled out. I need more information to narrow down the differential diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on McBurney's point tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign;  Pelvic exam (if female);  Vital signs including temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate

ToolMessage:
"Admission: Vitals: 97.9 97 129/75 16 100%   Gen: anxious, NAD Lungs: unlabored Cardio: RRR Abd: soft, tender to umb and RLQ, medial to McBurney's pt. No hernias noted. Non-peritoneal Rect: deferred Ext: wnl"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain localized to the lower abdomen, radiating to the lower right and umbilical area.  The physical exam reveals tenderness medial to McBurney's point, further increasing the suspicion for appendicitis.  While the patient is afebrile and the abdomen is soft, these findings do not rule out appendicitis.  Given the concerning presentation and physical exam findings, I would proceed with imaging to evaluate for appendicitis and other potential causes of abdominal pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Multi detector CT through the abdomen pelvis was performed with oral IV contrast material. Multiplanar reformations were provided.  FINDINGS: The imaged lung bases are clear. The imaged portion of the heart is unremarkable.   Abdomen: The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal. Kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly without hydronephrosis are worrisome renal lesion. The abdominal aorta is normal in course and caliber with widely patent major branches. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The stomach is decompressed. Duodenum is normal.    Pelvis: Loops of small bowel demonstrate no signs of ileus or obstruction. Within the right lower quadrant, the appendix is visualized, dilated with thickened wall and fluid-filled with surrounding fat stranding, compatible with ____. There is no evidence of acute complication, free air or extraluminal fluid collection. Trace free pelvic fluid is noted. The colon is unremarkable. Distal ureters appear normal. No free pelvic fluid. Urinary bladder appears distended and unremarkable.    Bones: No worrisome lytic or blastic osseous lesion. Transitional anatomy at the lumbosacral junction is noted with partial lumbarization of S1."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute lower abdominal pain, nausea, and anorexia. Physical exam revealed tenderness medial to McBurney's point. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, demonstrating a dilated appendix with thickened wall, fluid filling, and surrounding fat stranding.  There is no evidence of acute complications such as perforation or abscess.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute lower abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, and dry heaving. Physical exam revealed tenderness medial to McBurney's point. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with thickened wall, fluid filling, and surrounding fat stranding.  There is no evidence of perforation or abscess formation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Torsion (if female -  consider if diagnosis remains uncertain after negative appendectomy)
3. Ectopic Pregnancy (if female and of reproductive age - less likely given lack of vaginal bleeding or positive pregnancy test, but should be ruled out)
4. Mesenteric Adenitis
5. Urolithiasis

Treatment:  Given the CT findings confirming acute appendicitis without perforation, the recommended treatment is laparoscopic appendectomy.  The patient should be given IV fluids, analgesics, and antibiotics (covering gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria) preoperatively.  Post-operative care should include pain management, monitoring for complications (e.g., infection, bleeding), and early ambulation.  If the appendix is perforated or an abscess is present, a longer course of antibiotics and possible percutaneous drainage may be necessary.  The patient should be counseled on the signs and symptoms of post-operative complications and instructed to return to the hospital if they experience fever, increasing pain, or wound drainage.
