HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms ___ is a  ___ year old female who reports started  experiencing abdominal pain yesterday morning.She reports the  pain started suddenly after breakfast. She reports that the pain  was initially supra umbilical and during the course of the day migrated to the right lower quadrant. She denies any nausea, emesis or any changes in bowel movements. She also reports that she did not have an appetite during the course of the day yesterday. Due to pain increasing in severity she presents to the ED today. She denies any fevers, chills.     Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of sudden-onset abdominal pain migrating from the periumbilical region to the right lower quadrant, along with anorexia, raises suspicion for acute appendicitis. However, the absence of fever, nausea, or vomiting is atypical.  I need to gather more information to confirm or rule out appendicitis and consider other potential diagnoses like mesenteric adenitis, ovarian torsion, or a gynecological issue. A physical exam is necessary to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on palpation for tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate

ToolMessage:
"upon admission:  ___   Temp: 98.4 HR: 78 BP: 135/81 Resp: 16 O(2)Sat: 99 Normal   Constitutional: Comfortable Chest: Normal Cardiovascular: Normal Abdominal: Soft, Nondistended, tender palpation in the right lower quadrant with a positive Rovsing sign Extr/Back: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema Skin: Warm and dry Neuro: Speech fluent Psych: Normal mentation ___: No petechiae"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical exam findings of right lower quadrant tenderness with a positive Rovsing's sign further increase the suspicion for acute appendicitis.  The absence of fever and other systemic symptoms is still atypical, but not enough to rule out appendicitis.  Given the concerning physical exam findings, I would order a CT scan to evaluate the appendix and surrounding structures.  While a WBC count could be helpful, the CT scan is more specific in visualizing the appendix and can help identify alternative diagnoses.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Single phase contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 1) Spiral Acquisition 3.5 s, 46.7 cm; CTDIvol = 9.8 mGy (Body) DLP = 456.0 mGy-cm. 2) Stationary Acquisition 0.6 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 3.3 mGy (Body) DLP = 1.7 mGy-cm. 3) Stationary Acquisition 6.6 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 36.7 mGy (Body) DLP = 18.4 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 476 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Minimal atelectasis in the visualized lung bases. No pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. A subcentimeter left renal hypodensity is too small to characterize, likely a cyst. There is no hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is fluid-filled and dilated to approximately 1.4 cm (02:52), with periappendiceal fat stranding. A tubular calcification within the proximal appendix measures approximately 2.1 cm (601:16), compatible with an appendicolith. A smaller appendicolith in the distal appendix measures 0.8 cm (02:52). No evidence of perforation or adjacent fluid collection.  PELVIS: Apparent circumferential wall thickening of the bladder is likely due to decompression. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Uterus is retroflexed and otherwise unremarkable. There is a 2.6 cm cyst with a thin septation, versus two adjacent cysts in the left ovary. The right ovary is unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. A sclerotic focus of the left acetabulum (2:73) is likely a bone island. Incidentally noted limbus vertebra of L5.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, demonstrating a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding and appendicoliths.  The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT results are consistent with this diagnosis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:

The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT results all point towards this diagnosis.  The other differential diagnoses are less likely given the CT findings.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Ovarian Cyst (incidental finding)
4. Constipation
5. Gastroenteritis

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy.  This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the surgeon's preference and the patient's condition.
