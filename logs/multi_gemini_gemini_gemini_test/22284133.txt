Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ F s/p Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was recently found to have  elevated LFT in setting of intermittent RUQ pain. MRCP showed  that left intrahepatic ducts were mildly dilated and  "beaded-like" concerning for PSC. Today ERCP was attempted with  single balloon enteroscopy and ped ERCP scope through the  overtube. The ampulla was reached. However, because of the  floppy ampulla and difficult position, CBD cannulation was not  successful despite 2 hour try. Pt subsequently went to ___ where  she had successful ampullary dilatation and L PTBD. Admitted  directly to ___  ROS: c/o poast-op epigastric pain but denies n/v. denies f/c.  +c/o chest pain inferior aspect of sternum. denies dyspnea.    Past Medical History: - Obstructive Sleep Apnea on Bipap - S/p Open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ___  - Cholecystectomy   - s/p Bilateral Salpinooophorectomy ___    Social History: ___ Family History: - Mother with diabetes, hyperlipidemia - Sister and daughter with unclear thyroid disorder


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and now presents with elevated liver function tests (LFTs), intermittent right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, and dilated intrahepatic ducts concerning for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).  ERCP failed, but percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) was successful.  I need to understand the current status of her biliary drainage, degree of pain, and any signs of infection or other complications.

Thought: The labs are surprisingly normal, including LFTs and bilirubin, likely due to the successful PTBD.  Given the history of difficult ERCP and altered anatomy due to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, ongoing intermittent RUQ pain, and concern for PSC, I would want to assess the current biliary drainage status and evaluate for any other potential complications.
Action: imaging
Action Input: PTBD cholangiogram

ToolMessage:
"The closest matching study from the available list is the PTC (Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography) with biliary tube placement. Here's the full report:  PERC TRANSHEPATIC CHOLANGIOGRAPHY (PTC): PERCUTEOUS BILIARY TUBE PLACEMENT:     PROCEDURES:  1. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram.  2. Left biliary system brushings.  3. Left biliary system forcep biopsy  4. Ampullary dilatation.  5. Placement of left internal/external drain.    MEDICATIONS: General anesthesia was induced.    PROCEDURE: After discussion of the risks, benefits and alternatives to the procedure with the patient, written informed consent was obtained.  The patient was brought to the angiography suite and placed supine on theimaging table. A preprocedure timeout and huddle were performed per ___ protocol. General anesthesia was induced. The right upper quadrant and anterior abdominal wall were prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion.    Ultrasound was used to puncture peripheral left biliary system. The biliary tree opacified. A Headliner wire was advanced into the common bile duct. An AccuStick system was exchanged for the needle. After fluoroscopically-guided positioning, the wire and inner dilator and stiffener were removed and a .035 ___ wire advanced centrally. A safety wire was placed. A 6 ___ 23 cm ___ Tip sheath was then advanced.    An over-the-wire cholangiogram was performed. It demonstrated mildly irregular moderately dilated left biliary system and smooth ampullary stenosis.     Based on the results of the cholangiogram, decision was made to perform ampullary dilatation and brushings and biopsy of the left biliary system irregularities.  Two brushings were performed, followed by two forceps biopsies of the left biliary system. The ampulla was then dilated with 8mm x 40mm balloon. A smooth waist was seen at the ampulla during the initial dilatation.    The ___ Tip sheath was removed. Over the wire, an 8.5 ___ Cook multipurpose biliary catheter was advanced under fluoroscopic guidance. The pigtail was formed. The drain was optimally situated. Post-procedure cholangiograms were performed. The catheter was attached to the skin with statlock and attached to bag. Sterile dressings were applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. There were no immediate post-procedure complications and the patient was transferred to the PACU for recovery.    FINDINGS:  1. Diffuse, moderate bilateral intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation.  No definite stenosis identified in either the right or left system.  Mild irregularity of the left duct, similar to the findings on the recent MRI.  2. Smooth, tapered narrowing of the ampulla, consistent with some degree of ampullary stenosis.  Successful dilatation with an 8 mm balloon."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The PTBD cholangiogram shows diffuse, moderate bilateral intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, mild irregularity of the left duct, and ampullary stenosis that was successfully dilated during the procedure.  Brushings and biopsies were taken of the left biliary system irregularities.  The PTBD drain is in place and functioning.  Given the successful PTBD and ampullary dilatation, the patient's current relatively stable condition, and the information obtained, I have enough information to provide a differential diagnosis and suggest a treatment plan.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The PTBD cholangiogram shows diffuse, moderate bilateral intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with mild irregularity of the left duct, consistent with PSC.  A smooth, tapered narrowing of the ampulla was noted and dilated.  Brushings and biopsies were taken.  A left internal/external drain is in place.  The patient is currently post-procedure and recovering.  The next steps involve managing the biliary drain, awaiting biopsy results, and long-term management of PSC.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC)
2. Ampullary Stenosis
3. Post-operative stricture (less likely given the diffuse nature of the ductal dilatation)
4. Choledocholithiasis (unlikely given the cholangiogram findings)
5. IgG4-related cholangitis (less likely given the classic PSC picture)

Treatment:
* **Short-term:**
    * Monitor biliary drainage output and character.
    * Manage post-procedure pain.
    * Monitor for signs of infection (fever, chills, elevated WBC).
    * Await results of biliary brushings and biopsies.
* **Mid-term:**
    * If biopsies confirm PSC, initiate standard medical therapy (e.g., ursodeoxycholic acid).
    * Consider repeat cholangiography to assess biliary drainage and need for continued PTBD.  If drainage is adequate and no obstruction, the PTBD can be removed.
    * Evaluate for dominant strictures amenable to endoscopic dilation or stenting.
* **Long-term:**
    * Regular monitoring of LFTs, bilirubin, and coagulation studies.
    * Surveillance for cholangiocarcinoma (given increased risk with PSC).  This may involve periodic imaging (MRI/MRCP) and/or CA 19-9 monitoring.
    * Management of associated conditions (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease).
    * Liver transplantation evaluation if PSC progresses to end-stage liver disease.
    * Patient education regarding PSC, its complications, and management.
