Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Pt is an ___  on Pradaxa who presented to the ___ ED with a  6day hx of mild RUQ pain, poor PO intake and hypotension.  She  states that she has a very rich meal 6days  ago for a family  celebration and felt very full and unwell afterwards.  She had  RUQ abdominal pain relieved by antacids and burning.  She has taken very little PO since that time.  She has  had loose stools as well but took Immodium and has not stooled  in the 2d prior to presentation.  For the past two days she has  also experienced profound hypotension and has been unable to  stand without dizziness and risk of fall.  She was seen by her  doctor today and was found to be hypotensive with BP 80/38, HR  48-52 and irreg.  She was afebrile with FSBS 148 and guiac neg.     Past Medical History: HTN   Glucose intolerance   OA   Hypothyroid   AVNRT--rx verapamil and atenolol   Skin Ca: nose. squamous cell   GI: non bleeding grade 3 hemorrhoids, erosive gastritis   Transitional Carcinoma of Bladder: rx locally without recurrence   Social History: ___ Family History: Breast ca: sister, mat aunt.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a concerning constellation of symptoms including prolonged right upper quadrant pain, poor oral intake, hypotension, and bradycardia. The onset of symptoms after a large meal raises suspicion for biliary pathology, such as cholecystitis or cholangitis. However, the prolonged hypotension and bradycardia are unusual for simple biliary disease and warrant further investigation. Given the patient's history of AVNRT and use of verapamil and atenolol, a cardiac etiology for her hypotension and bradycardia must also be considered. Additionally, her history of erosive gastritis raises the possibility of a gastrointestinal bleed, although her guaiac negative stool makes this less likely.  Her age, history of glucose intolerance, and recent poor oral intake could be contributing to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances exacerbating her hypotension.  Finally, her use of Pradaxa, an anticoagulant, increases the risk of bleeding complications. To differentiate between these possibilities, I need more information.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results reveal a mild normocytic anemia, which could be chronic or related to recent poor oral intake.  Her coagulation studies (INR, aPTT, PT) are significantly elevated, suggesting an increased risk of bleeding due to her Pradaxa use.  The normal lipase, bilirubin, AST, and ALT make biliary pathology less likely.  The normal lactic acid argues against sepsis or severe tissue hypoperfusion.  The slightly low chloride may be related to dehydration or other electrolyte imbalances.  The lack of troponin and blood culture results makes it difficult to fully assess for a cardiac etiology or infection.  Given the patient's hypotension, bradycardia, and elevated INR, I suspect the patient is experiencing a bleeding event, possibly retroperitoneal, which could explain her abdominal pain and hypotension.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is necessary to evaluate for bleeding.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast report from the available studies:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast. Multiplanar reformations were obtained and reviewed.  The partially imaged lungs show mild bibasilar atelectasis. The partially imaged heart is unremarkable except for mitral annular calcification.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver is fatty infiltrated. The spleen, both adrenals, both kidneys (with multiple benign-appearing cysts within them), and pancreas are unremarkable. The gallbladder is notable for only moderate distension, gallbladder wall thickening with mild pericholecystic fluid. No calcified gallstones seen. No abdominal, retroperitoneal, or mesenteric lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria is present. No abdominal free fluid or free air is present. The small and large bowel loops are unremarkable.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and both adnexa are unremarkable. The uterus is shrunken with multiple calcified fibroids. Endometrium difficult to assess given the diffusely hypodense appearance of the uterus. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy or pelvic free fluid is present.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The visible osseous structures show moderate degenerative change with intervertebral disc space narrowing, vacuum phenomena, and endplate sclerosis at multiple levels as well as grade 1 anterolisthesis of L3 on L4. No fractures, acute lytic or blastic lesions are present."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with right upper quadrant pain, poor oral intake, hypotension, and bradycardia.  Initial labs showed mild anemia and significantly elevated coagulation studies (INR, aPTT, PT) while other labs, including lipase and bilirubin, were normal.  The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast ruled out significant intra-abdominal or retroperitoneal bleeding, though it did show mild gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid, suggesting possible cholecystitis.  However, this finding is unlikely to fully explain the patient's profound hypotension and bradycardia.  Given the patient's history of AVNRT and use of beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, her current presentation could be due to a combination of dehydration, medication effects, and possible early cholecystitis exacerbated by her coagulopathy.  The elevated INR, while likely due to Pradaxa, may also be contributing to her symptoms.  I believe I have enough information to make a recommendation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acalculous Cholecystitis
2. Dehydration exacerbated by Pradaxa use and underlying cardiac history
3. Adverse reaction to Pradaxa (contributing to bleeding risk)
4. AVNRT exacerbation
5. Erosive gastritis (less likely given normal labs and imaging)

Treatment:
1. Admit the patient for IV fluids and electrolyte correction.  Closely monitor vital signs, including heart rate and rhythm, and blood pressure.
2. Discontinue Pradaxa and consult hematology for guidance on reversing its anticoagulant effects, given the elevated INR and the possibility of needing surgery. Consider administering vitamin K or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) as per hematology recommendations.
3. Obtain a surgical consultation for evaluation of cholecystitis.  If the diagnosis is confirmed, cholecystectomy should be considered.  The timing of surgery will depend on the patient's hemodynamic stability and the successful reversal of Pradaxa's anticoagulant effects.
4.  Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover potential infection, especially given the presence of gallbladder wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid.
5.  Closely monitor the patient's cardiac rhythm and consider a cardiology consult if there are any significant arrhythmias.  Adjust or temporarily discontinue atenolol and verapamil if bradycardia persists or worsens.
6.  Once the patient is hemodynamically stable and the acute cholecystitis is resolved, reassess her anticoagulation needs and consider alternative anticoagulants if Pradaxa is deemed too high risk.
7.  Educate the patient on the importance of maintaining adequate hydration and recognizing signs of dehydration.
