HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ presented to ___ ED earlier this morning with complaints  of RUQ/epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, and profuse vomiting  after drinking 7 alcoholic beverages last night. She denies  hematemesis, diarrhea, fever, chills, or changes in her bowels.  She states that she has had episodes like this three other times  in the past, once ___ year ago (precipitated by food), and twice in the past two months (precipitated by heavy alcohol  intake). She usually takes omeprazole for these attacks, and her  symptoms resolve. She had a RUQ US that showed cholelithiasis  with no definite evidence of cholecysitis. She received  dilaudid, Zofran, and Ativan in the ED, and she felt better and  was discharged home.   Three hours later, her pain returned ___ in the RUQ. She  continues to have nausea, but has not vomited since leaving the  ED. She continues to deny fever/chills/diarrhea. Has not had  anything to eat today. Upon return to the ED, she had a CT scan  which showed GB wall thickening that was thought to be reactive  in the setting of mild hepatitis.   Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ ___: Mother had gallbladder removed


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with recurrent RUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting, especially after alcohol or food intake.  She has a history of cholelithiasis and a recent CT showing GB wall thickening. While the CT report suggests reactive thickening due to mild hepatitis, her recurrent symptoms in the context of cholelithiasis raise suspicion for acute cholecystitis. I need to gather more information to assess for signs of cholecystitis and rule out other potential causes of her symptoms.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Murphy's sign, assessment for fever, right upper quadrant palpation for tenderness and guarding, auscultation of bowel sounds

ToolMessage:
"Vitals: 97.7, HR 64, BP 116/76, RR 14, 100% RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender to palpation in RUQ, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused  Physical Examination"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with recurrent RUQ pain worsened by fatty foods and alcohol, history of cholelithiasis, and CT findings of GB wall thickening are highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis. The physical exam findings of RUQ tenderness further support this diagnosis.  While she does not have a fever or Murphy's sign, these are not always present in early cholecystitis.  Given the recurrence of her symptoms despite initial treatment, I am confident in the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Biliary colic
2. Acute cholecystitis
3. Chronic cholecystitis
4. Alcohol-induced gastritis
5. Hepatitis

Treatment: 
* NPO status initially.
* IV fluids for hydration.
* Analgesia: IV NSAIDs (e.g., ketorolac) or opioids (e.g., morphine) if NSAIDs are contraindicated or insufficient.
* Antiemetics: IV ondansetron or metoclopramide.
* Surgical consultation for possible cholecystectomy. If the diagnosis is biliary colic, discuss elective cholecystectomy given her recurrent symptoms and history of cholelithiasis. If acute cholecystitis is suspected, early laparoscopic cholecystectomy is preferred.
* Monitor vital signs, including temperature, and white blood cell count for any signs of infection or worsening inflammation.
* If symptoms improve, transition to a clear liquid diet and then advance as tolerated.
* Provide patient education on a low-fat diet and avoiding alcohol, especially if cholecystectomy is planned or performed.
