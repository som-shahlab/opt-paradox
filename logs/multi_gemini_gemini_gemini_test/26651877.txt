HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr ___ is a ___ yo man who awoke from sleep at 2am this  night feeling abdominal bloating with epigastric pressure and  cramping pain ___ severity). He passed a solid stool bowel  movement but the pain persisted. The pain did not radiate to the  chest/back/shoulders, was relieved by standing up, and worsened  by sitting. He returned to bed but could not sleep due to  persisting pain and bloating, with increased belching and  feeling cold and clammy. Overnight the pain was constant and  gradually spread and localized to the right abdomen, especially  the RLQ. He had one more solid stool BM at 7am before presenting  to the ED, and a soft stool BM in the ED after CT contrast  ingestion.    Past Medical History: GERD - occurs with fatty foods and regularly every night if does not take Ranitidine. Mild hyperglycemia noted previously by physician, treated with only exercise and diet.    Social History: ___ Family History: Father - died of MI at age ___, DM2, HTN Mother - none. Mother's siblings- throat and breast cancer. Sister - DM2, HTN. Brother - CAD, MI at age ___


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms and history suggest several possible diagnoses, including appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, or even a gastrointestinal obstruction.  Given the shift in pain location to the RLQ, appendicitis is high on the differential.  I need to gather more information to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, and Rovsing's sign), rectal exam

ToolMessage:
"Physical Exam upon admission: Vitals: T 96.3 P 73 BP 132/83 RR 16 O2 100% GEN: A&Ox3, NAD HEENT: CNII-XII intact. Sclerae anicteric. Normal oral mucosa. CV: No JVD, RRR, Split S1, No M/R PULM: Symmetric inspiration. Clear to auscultation bilat, No  wheezes, rhonchi, rales. ABD: Bowel sounds audible. Soft, nondistended, tender to  palpation at epigastrium and right side of abdomen, especially  at RLQ. Rebound tenderness and tender to percussion over RLQ. No  guarding. (-) Rosving's sign. (-) Psoas sign. (-) Obturator  sign. No palpable masses. DRE: normal tone, no gross or occult blood. Ext: UE and ___ well perfused, brisk nail capillary refill. No ___  edema. Strength- forearm flex/ext, thigh flex/ext, and leg  flex/ext nl.  Physical Exam"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain that initially started in the epigastric region and later localized to the RLQ.  The presence of rebound tenderness and tenderness to percussion in the RLQ, along with the patient's history and vital signs, raises strong suspicion for appendicitis. While Rosving's, Psoas, and Obturator signs are negative, these are not always positive in appendicitis.  A CT scan would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities like cholecystitis or diverticulitis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast report. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained of the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast. Reformatted coronal and sagittal images were also reviewed.  FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN: The bases of the lungs are clear. The liver enhances homogeneously with no evidence of focal lesions. The portal vein is patent. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is unremarkable. The pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands, bilateral kidneys and spleen are normal in appearance. The stomach, duodenum and small bowel are unremarkable with no evidence of wall thickening or obstruction. The intra-abdominal vasculature is normal in appearance with a normal caliber aorta throughout and a widely patent celiac axis, superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric artery. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria. No intraperitoneal free air or free fluid is identified.  Within the right lower quadrant, there is a fluid-filled blind-ending structure(2:57) which measures 11 mm in diameter with mucosal hyperenhancement with surrounding inflammatory fat stranding. No oral contrast is seen within the appendix. No extraluminal air or drainable fluid collection is identified. The ascending, transverse and descending colon are unremarkable, with no evidence of wall thickening or obstruction. Oral contrast material is seen passing to the level of the rectum.  CT PELVIS: The bladder and terminal ureters are normal in appearance. The prostate, seminal vesicles and rectum are normal. There is no pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymph node enlargement. No pelvic free fluid is identified.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No lytic or sclerotic lesion suspicious for malignancy is present."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, tenderness to palpation and percussion in the RLQ, and the CT findings of a fluid-filled blind-ending structure in the right lower quadrant measuring 11 mm in diameter with mucosal hyperenhancement and surrounding inflammatory fat stranding are highly suggestive of appendicitis. The absence of oral contrast within the appendix further supports this diagnosis.  Other potential diagnoses, such as cholecystitis and diverticulitis, have been ruled out by the CT scan.
