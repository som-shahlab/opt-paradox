HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___. male p/w periumbilical abdominal pain x 1 day that  evolved into RLQ pain with nausea and NBNB emesis.    Past Medical History: PMH none  PSH 1. Left orchiectomy for testicular torsion    Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, nausea, and non-bloody emesis. This presentation is highly suggestive of appendicitis.  However, other diagnoses such as mesenteric adenitis, Meckel's diverticulitis, or a urologic issue need to be ruled out. A physical exam is necessary to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure

ToolMessage:
"T: 98.1  P: 101  BP: 141/72  RR: 18  O2sat: 100% on RA General: awake, alert, NAD HEENT: NCAT, EOMI, PERRLA, anicteric Heart: RRR, NMRG Lungs: CTAB, normal excursion, no respiratory distress Back: no vertebral tenderness, no CVAT Abdomen: soft, mild RLQ tenderness, +Rovsing's sign, ND, no  mass, no hernia Pelvis: deferred Neuro: strength intact/symmetric, sensation intact/symmetric Extremities: WWP, no CCE, no tenderness, 2+ B ___ Skin: no rashes/lesions/ulcers Pyschiatric: normal judgment/insight, normal memory, normal  mood/affect"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of migrating periumbilical to RLQ pain, nausea, non-bloody emesis, along with a physical exam revealing mild RLQ tenderness and a positive Rovsing's sign, strongly suggests appendicitis.  While other diagnoses like mesenteric adenitis or Meckel's diverticulitis are still possible, the current findings warrant further investigation to confirm appendicitis and determine the severity.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is the most sensitive imaging modality for visualizing the appendix and assessing for inflammation or complications like perforation.  A complete blood count (CBC) is also necessary to assess for leukocytosis, which is often present in appendicitis.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential

ToolMessage:
"I'll provide the results for the CBC (Complete Blood Count) with differential:  White Blood Cells: 13.9 K/uL Red Blood Cells: 5.26 m/uL Hemoglobin: 14.6 g/dL Hematocrit: 42.3% MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume): 81.0 fL MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin): 27.7 pg MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration): 34.5% RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width): 13.3% Platelet Count: 289.0 K/uL  Differential: - Neutrophils: 81.2% - Lymphocytes: 11.5% - Monocytes: 5.9% - Eosinophils: 0.6% - Basophils: 0.8%  All components of the CBC with differential are available in the laboratory results."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings (RLQ tenderness, positive Rovsing's sign), and laboratory results (leukocytosis with neutrophilia) are highly consistent with acute appendicitis.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast was previously indicated and should be performed to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications such as perforation or abscess formation.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT) matches the requested CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the full report:  TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained after the administration of oral contrast and 130 mL IV Optiray contrast. Axial, coronal, and sagittal reformations were prepared.  FINDINGS: Within the included portions of the lung bases, there is mild bilateral dependent atelectasis. Within the abdomen, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys appear unremarkable. Intra-abdominal loops of small and large bowel are of normal size and caliber. Within the pelvis, a 9 x 7 mm appendicolith is seen (2:72). The appendix distal to this is dilated up to 12 mm with surrounding inflammatory fat stranding. A smaller appendicolith measuring 3 mm is seen near the tip. No free air or fluid collection is seen. There is colonic diverticulosis. Several, likely reactive lymph nodes are seen in the right lower quadrant. The bladder, distal ureters and prostate gland appear unremarkable. No concerning osseous lesion is seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, accompanied by nausea and non-bloody emesis. Physical examination revealed mild RLQ tenderness and a positive Rovsing's sign. Laboratory findings showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, demonstrating an enlarged appendix with appendicoliths and surrounding inflammatory fat stranding.  No perforation or abscess is noted.  The patient requires an appendectomy.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's clinical presentation of migrating periumbilical to RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and physical exam findings of RLQ tenderness and a positive Rovsing's sign strongly suggested appendicitis. The CBC showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, further supporting this diagnosis. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, demonstrating an appendicolith, a dilated appendix, and surrounding inflammatory fat stranding.  The absence of free air or fluid collection suggests that the appendix is not perforated.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Meckel's Diverticulitis
4. Right ureteral calculus
5. Epiploic appendagitis

Treatment:  The patient should be admitted for laparoscopic appendectomy.  Administer IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte management.  Provide pre-operative antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, such as cefoxitin or a combination of ceftriaxone and metronidazole.  Post-operatively, continue IV fluids and antibiotics as needed.  Monitor for complications such as wound infection, abscess formation, or ileus.  Advance diet as tolerated and provide pain management.  Discharge instructions should include wound care, pain management, activity restrictions, and follow-up appointment.
