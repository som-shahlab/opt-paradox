HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old woman with a history of anxiety, agoraphobia, and panic attacks, who came to the ED on  ___ for evaluation of acute epigastric abdominal pain that began early that morning.   She reports she woke up the morning of ___ with  "indigestion" and after going to the bathroom, developed severe abdominal pain in a band-like distribution in her epigastric region underneath both her breasts. The pain was described as radiating around both  sides and into her back, worse on the L than on the R. The patient's pain was accompanied by several episodes of nausea and NB/NB  vomiting.  She then presented to the ___ ED where her pain improved on  morphine and she did not vomit any more.    Past Medical History: PMH: anxiety, agoraphobia, osteoporosis, breast ca, s/p lumpectomy and radiation  PSH: L lumpectomy, removal of back cyst    Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory

Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back, accompanied by nausea and vomiting.  Given her history of anxiety, it's important to rule out serious gastrointestinal issues like pancreatitis, cholecystitis, or peptic ulcer disease, as well as cardiac issues.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show significantly elevated lipase and amylase, along with elevated WBCs and neutrophils, pointing towards acute pancreatitis.  The elevated AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase suggest possible biliary involvement.  The troponin is normal, ruling out a cardiac event. I have enough information to make a recommendation.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric pain radiating to the back, accompanied by nausea and vomiting.  The significantly elevated lipase (17740 U/L) and amylase (203 U/L), along with elevated WBC (13.6 K/uL) and neutrophils (92.1%), strongly suggest acute pancreatitis.  The elevated ALT (465 U/L), AST (407 U/L), and alkaline phosphatase (467 U/L) could indicate gallstone-related pancreatitis or other biliary involvement.  Her history of anxiety, while important to consider, is less likely to be the primary cause of her current symptoms given the lab results.  Cardiac causes are unlikely given the normal troponin.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Pancreatitis
2. Gallstone Pancreatitis
3. Cholecystitis
4. Peptic Ulcer Disease
5. Gastritis

Treatment: The patient should be admitted for management of acute pancreatitis.  Treatment includes:
* **NPO status:**  To allow the pancreas to rest.
* **Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation:**  To maintain hemodynamic stability.  Lactated Ringer's solution is typically preferred.
* **Pain management:** IV opioids (e.g., morphine, hydromorphone) are often necessary to control pain.
* **Anti-emetics:**  To control nausea and vomiting (e.g., ondansetron, promethazine).
* **Monitoring:** Closely monitor vital signs, fluid balance, and laboratory values (lipase, amylase, electrolytes, CBC, renal function).
* **Further investigations:** Abdominal ultrasound or CT scan to evaluate for gallstones and assess the severity of pancreatitis.  MRCP may be considered if biliary obstruction is suspected.
* **Nutritional support:** If the patient remains NPO for more than 5-7 days, consider enteral nutrition via nasojejunal feeding tube.  Parenteral nutrition should be reserved for cases where enteral nutrition is not feasible.
* **Gallstone management:** If gallstones are identified as the cause of pancreatitis, cholecystectomy should be considered during the same admission or shortly after recovery from the acute episode.
* **Alcohol cessation counseling:** If alcohol is suspected as a contributing factor.
