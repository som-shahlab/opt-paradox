HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ symptoms of reflux and epigastric discomfort on tue night.  Saw health service at ___, given antacids and symptoms  improved. Over the next day, region of discomfort moved to RLQ  although pain reduced in intensity. Patient only feels  tenderness on mobilisation. Patient denies fever, palpitationsm  dizziness, diarrhoea or urinary symptoms.    Past Medical History: PMH: None  PSH: Tonsillectomy Widom tooth extraction    Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with migrating abdominal pain starting in the epigastric region and moving to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). While the initial symptoms suggested reflux, the shift to RLQ raises suspicion for appendicitis.  The absence of fever, diarrhea, or urinary symptoms doesn't rule out appendicitis. I need to gather more information through physical examination to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness localized to the RLQ.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign, Rebound tenderness,  Auscultation of bowel sounds

ToolMessage:
"Pre-Op  98.0 87 137/70 18 98%RA Gen: WD/WN, comfortable, NAD. HEENT: Unremarkable Neck: Supple, no tenderness to palpation Abd: Soft, point tenderness over Mcburney's point Extrem: Warm and well-perfused.  Neuro: Mental status: Awake and alert, cooperative with exam, normal affect."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's initial epigastric pain migrating to the RLQ, along with point tenderness over McBurney's point, strongly suggests appendicitis.  The absence of fever and other symptoms doesn't rule it out, as appendicitis can present variably. While the patient reports only tenderness on mobilization, the localized tenderness at McBurney's point during the physical exam increases the likelihood of appendicitis.  I will recommend a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of RLQ pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast report, which matches your request. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired through abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. No oral contrast was administered.  DOSE: DLP: 134 mGy-cm (abdomen and pelvis) IV Contrast: 130 mL Omnipaque  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: 4 mm right lower lobe pulmonary nodule is partially visualized, likely benign in this age group, otherwise the visualized lung bases are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits, without stones or gallbladder wall thickening.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of stones, focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There are no urothelial lesions in the kidneys or ureters. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness and enhancement throughout. Colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is dilated, fluid filled measuring 12 mm in diameter with hyper enhancing walls and surrounding fat stranding, consistent with ____. No abscess identified. No free air. Mildly prominent surrounding lymph nodes are reactive. Mild thickening of the adjacent lateral conal fascia.  RETROPERITONEUM: There is no evidence of retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is no calcium burden in the abdominal aorta and great abdominal arteries.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. Prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.  BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is no evidence of worrisome lesions. There is bilateral spondylolysis at L5 with grade I/II spondylolisthesis of L5 on S1. Mild to moderate degenerative changes are noted along L5-S1. Abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  NOTIFICATION: These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 20:25 on ___ by telephone at time of discovery."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with hyperenhancing walls and surrounding fat stranding.  The patient's presentation and physical exam findings, combined with the CT results, provide sufficient evidence for a diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of migrating pain from the epigastric region to the RLQ, McBurney's point tenderness, and the CT findings of a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with hyperenhancing walls and surrounding fat stranding confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric adenitis
3. Right ureteral calculus
4. Ovarian cyst (if female)
5. Epiploic appendagitis


Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment. This can be performed laparoscopically or open, with laparoscopic appendectomy being the preferred approach due to its minimally invasive nature, reduced postoperative pain, and faster recovery.  The patient should be started on intravenous fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin, or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole) preoperatively.  Postoperative care includes pain management, monitoring for complications such as infection or abscess formation, and early ambulation.  The patient should be advised to follow up with their surgeon for wound care and to discuss any concerns.
