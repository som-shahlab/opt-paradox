HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/ recurrent episodes of RUQ pain well correlated with fatty meal consumption.  She notes pain since eating a meatball sub two days ago, and went to her PCP's office who sent her for an US.  Outside U/S demonstrated gb wall thickening and stones, with a frankly positive ___ sign.  Repeated here with similary results but gb non-distended.  Frankly tender to RUQ with good story.  No elevation in LFT's or WBC, but given  general health of the patient, we may simply proceed with lap chole  given appropriate symptoms and story.    Past Medical History: PMHx: htn PSHx: lap tubal ligation    Social History: ___ Family History: non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with recurrent right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain correlated with fatty meals, a positive Murphy's sign on ultrasound, and tenderness to palpation in the RUQ.  These findings are highly suggestive of cholecystitis. While the patient's labs are normal, her symptoms and imaging findings warrant further investigation to definitively rule out other potential causes and complications. Specifically, I need to know the patient's age and vital signs to assess their overall condition. Additionally, I would like to know the size of the gallstones and the degree of gallbladder wall thickening to better assess the risk of complications.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Repeat Ultrasound, focusing on gallstone size and degree of wall thickening;  MRCP

ToolMessage:
"From the requested imaging studies (repeat ultrasound and MRCP), I can only find one liver/gallbladder ultrasound in the available imaging list. However, this appears to be the initial ultrasound, not the requested repeat ultrasound. Neither the repeat ultrasound nor the MRCP are available in the provided list of available imaging studies.  Therefore, I cannot retrieve the requested imaging reports as they are not available in the provided list."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a classic history for cholecystitis: recurrent RUQ pain associated with fatty meals, positive Murphy's sign, and gallbladder wall thickening and stones on ultrasound.  While the lack of leukocytosis and normal LFTs are atypical, they do not rule out cholecystitis.  Given the patient's clear symptoms, exam findings, and ultrasound results, along with the potential risks of delaying surgery, proceeding with a laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a reasonable approach.  Additional imaging like MRCP would be helpful to evaluate the biliary tree for stones or other pathology, but given the patient's presentation and the potential for complications like perforation or gangrene with delayed treatment, proceeding with surgery is justified.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with recurrent right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain associated with fatty meal consumption.  The pain started two days ago after eating a meatball sub.  An outside ultrasound showed gallstones and gallbladder wall thickening with a positive Murphy's sign, findings corroborated by a repeat ultrasound.  The patient is tender in the RUQ.  LFTs and WBC are normal.  The patient has a history of hypertension and a laparoscopic tubal ligation. Family history is non-contributory.  The combination of symptoms, physical exam findings, and ultrasound results strongly suggests acute cholecystitis.  While lab values are normal, they do not rule out cholecystitis, and given the patient's presentation, surgical intervention is warranted.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Cholecystitis
2. Biliary Dyskinesia
3. Choledocholithiasis
4. Peptic Ulcer Disease
5. Gastritis

Treatment: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the recommended treatment given the patient's presentation and imaging findings.  Pre-operative assessment should include a thorough review of the patient's medical history, a physical examination, and standard pre-operative blood work.  The patient should be NPO after midnight the night before surgery.  Post-operative care should include pain management, early ambulation, and monitoring for complications such as bleeding, infection, and bile leak.  The patient should be educated on dietary modifications following surgery, including a low-fat diet initially.
