HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
29 G1P1 Female developed ___ partum paroxysmal right upper quadrant abdominal pain, which occasionally radiated to her  back, and caused nausea, the pain came in a crescendo like pattern and peaked at about an hour but then remitted. She saw her PCP about it who suggested a right upper quadrant ultrasound as he suspected biliary colic. He further recommended that she present to the ED if she ever developed the symptoms again. The morning of presentation the symptoms developed and did not remit.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: G1P1; Dermatomyositis  Past Surgical History: C-section    Social History: ___ Family History: not contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a 29-year-old G1P1 female with recurrent, now persistent, right upper quadrant pain radiating to the back, associated with nausea. This presentation is concerning for biliary colic or other biliary pathology, such as cholecystitis, given the postprandial nature and crescendo pattern of the pain.  Her history of dermatomyositis raises the possibility of muscle-related pain, but the location and association with nausea point towards a biliary etiology.  To further evaluate this, I need to assess her vital signs, perform a physical exam focused on the abdomen, and review laboratory and imaging results.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, Murphy's sign, abdominal tenderness, abdominal distension, bowel sounds

ToolMessage:
"On admission: 97.4 69 ___ 97% RA  General: awake, alert, oriented x 3 HEENT: EOMI, anicteric Heart: RRR, NMRG Lungs: CTAB Abdomen: soft, ND, RUQ tenderness, ___ sign"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with persistent RUQ pain, nausea, and a positive Murphy's sign, which strongly suggests cholecystitis.  Given her history of dermatomyositis, it's important to consider other potential causes of abdominal pain, such as muscle inflammation or drug-induced pancreatitis (if she is on corticosteroids). However, the classic presentation points towards biliary pathology.  A RUQ ultrasound will help visualize the gallbladder and assess for the presence of gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, or pericholecystic fluid, confirming the diagnosis of cholecystitis.  Laboratory tests will be helpful to assess for leukocytosis, which would further support the diagnosis of cholecystitis, and to evaluate her liver function and amylase/lipase levels to rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC, CMP, lipase, amylase

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including persistent RUQ pain, nausea, a positive Murphy's sign, and leukocytosis, strongly suggests cholecystitis.  The normal liver function tests, lipase, and amylase help rule out other causes of abdominal pain, such as pancreatitis or hepatitis.  While the amylase result is missing, the normal lipase makes pancreatitis less likely.  A RUQ ultrasound is crucial to visualize the gallbladder and confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: RUQ ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested RUQ ultrasound matches the LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) study that is available. Here is the complete report:  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  TECHNIQUE: Grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound examination of the right upper quadrant was performed.  FINDINGS: Liver does not show focal lesions or textural abnormality. There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Gallbladder contains several shadowing stones but there is no wall thickening, wall edema, or pericholecystic fluid. Common bile duct measures up to 5 mm. The pancreas is unremarkable. Limited view of the right kidney is within normal limits. Portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of persistent RUQ pain, nausea, positive Murphy's sign, and leukocytosis, combined with the ultrasound findings of gallstones without gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, suggests biliary colic rather than acute cholecystitis.  The absence of gallbladder wall thickening, edema, or pericholecystic fluid on ultrasound argues against acute cholecystitis.  The patient's symptoms are likely due to gallstones causing transient obstruction and biliary colic.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Biliary Colic
2. Early Cholecystitis
