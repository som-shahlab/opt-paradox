HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with abdominal pain that started today at 0200 am and awoke  her from sleep. She describes the pain as sharp and constant.  Currently ___ down from ___. Tried an unclear medication that  did not help. Small amount of diarrhea without blood. She says  the pain is all over her abdomen and no focal. Denies fevers or  chills. No nausea or vomiting. Has never had pain like this  before. Last ate yesterday.    Past Medical History: PMH: denies PSH: C section x2    Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute, severe abdominal pain with diffuse localization. Given the sudden onset, severity, and lack of focal symptoms, several serious conditions need to be ruled out, including appendicitis, bowel obstruction, perforation, and other acute abdominal emergencies.  I need more information to narrow down the differential diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation including McBurney's point and rebound tenderness), rectal exam

ToolMessage:
"Physical Exam on Admission: 98.1 60 114/69 16 98% room air GEN: NAD, A+Ox3 HEENT: no scleral icterus, oropharynx clear CV: RRR PULM: CTAB ABD: soft, no distention. focally tender RLQ. +Rovsing's. no rebound. well healed ___ scar. EXT: no edema. warm, well perfused. palpable DP pulses bilaterally"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute, severe abdominal pain, now localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ).  The positive Rovsing's sign further suggests appendicitis.  The vital signs are stable, and the patient is not reporting fever, which is somewhat atypical for appendicitis but not impossible.  Given the concerning physical exam findings, I would want to confirm the suspicion of appendicitis with imaging.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the full report for the CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST, which matches your requested imaging:  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the lesser trochanters. IV contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were prepared. DOSE: DLP: 379 mGy-cm  FINDINGS: Thorax: There is minimal bibasilar atelectasis. The heart and pericardium are normal.  Liver: The liver is normal in size and attenuation. No focal hepatic lesions are identified. The portal vein is patent. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.  Gallbladder: The gallbladder is normal-appearing.  Spleen: The spleen is normal in size and enhancement.  Pancreas: The pancreas shows normal enhancement. There is no pancreatic duct dilatation or peripancreatic fat stranding.  Adrenals: The adrenal glands are unremarkable bilaterally.  Kidneys: The kidneys display symmetric nephrograms with no evidence of hydronephrosis or mass lesion in either kidney. The ureters are symmetrical in their course to the bladder.  Bowel: The appendix is dilated to 9 mm (series 2, image 55 and series 601b, image 25). There is minimal periappendiceal fat stranding. There is no evidence of periappendiceal fluid collection. The small bowel is normal appearing with no evidence of obstruction. The colon is normal.  Vessels: There is no aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta. The aorta and its major branches are patent.  Lymph Nodes: There are no pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes by CT size criteria.  Pelvis: The bladder is unremarkable. There is a 2.1 x 1.7 cystic structure in the right adnexa which most likely represents a dominant follicle within the ovary. The uterine cavity is distended with fluid, which can be a normal finding in in premenopausal women the rectum and sigmoid colon are normal. There is no free fluid or free air are seen in the pelvis.  Osseous Structures/ Soft Tissues: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions seen in the visualized osseous structures."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with acute abdominal pain localized to the RLQ, positive Rovsing's sign, and the CT finding of a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding are highly suggestive of acute appendicitis.  The absence of fever and the minimal periappendiceal fat stranding could indicate early appendicitis.  However, the clinical picture and imaging findings are sufficient to make a diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute RLQ pain with a positive Rovsing's sign, combined with the CT findings of a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding, strongly supports the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. While the patient doesn't exhibit fever, this is not uncommon in early appendicitis. The other findings on the CT scan, such as the ovarian cyst and uterine fluid, are likely incidental and not related to the current abdominal pain.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Cyst (incidental)
3. Mesenteric Adenitis (less likely given CT findings)
4. Right Lower Quadrant Pain (nonspecific, less likely given CT findings)
5. Early Bowel Obstruction (less likely given CT findings)

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for appendectomy is recommended.  This should be done expeditiously to minimize the risk of complications such as perforation.  Pre-operative management should include intravenous fluids, pain control, and prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of metronidazole and ceftriaxone).  Post-operative care should include pain management, wound care, and monitoring for complications.
