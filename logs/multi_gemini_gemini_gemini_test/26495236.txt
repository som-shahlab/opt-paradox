HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/ no PMH who presents with a one day h/o RLQ abdominal pain associated with nausea and diarrhea. No appetite. Has never had similar symptoms. No recent travel or sick contacts. No testicular pain or penile drainage.   ROS: (+) per HPI (-) Denies night sweats, unexplained weight loss, trouble with sleep, pruritis, jaundice, rashes, bleeding, easy bruising, headache, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, weakness, paresthesias, hematemesis, bloating, cramping, melena, BRBPR, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, edema, urinary frequency, urgency   Past Medical History: PMH none  PSH none   Social History: ___ Family History: nocontrubutory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and diarrhea, which could indicate appendicitis.  Given the lack of other symptoms, it's important to rule out other potential causes in the RLQ such as ovarian cysts or kidney stones.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign,  rectal exam, Murphy's sign,  pelvic exam (if female)

ToolMessage:
"Admission Exam Vitals: 99  79  142/89  19  98 RA GEN: A&Ox3, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR PULM: no respiratory distress ABD: Soft, nondistended, TTP in RLQ, no rebound or guarding Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, diarrhea, and point tenderness in the RLQ, along with the absence of other concerning findings on physical exam, strongly suggests appendicitis.  While other diagnoses are possible, the current information points towards appendicitis as the most likely cause.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
