HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/ hx of recurrent symptomatic cholelithiasis with acute  abdominal pain.  Pain began at 0200, was epigastric in location  then moved to the RUQ with radiation to the back.  Pain was  associated with nausea, vomiting x3 of yellow liquid without  blood, and chills. Pt endorses mild chest pain, similar to her heartburn symptoms. Pt denies fevers, sweats, and SOB.  BM x2  this morning, normal, no blood. Denies urinary symptoms.  Last  food intake was last night at 7 pm, last fluid intake was a sip  of water this morning.    Past Medical History: PMH: ?GERD lower back pain  PSH: b/l tubal ligation C-section x1    Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of biliary colic or other gallbladder-related pathology, such as cholecystitis. Given her history of recurrent symptomatic cholelithiasis, these conditions are high on the differential. However, other diagnoses such as pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, or myocardial infarction need to be ruled out.  I need to gather more information through laboratory tests and imaging to narrow down the diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show leukocytosis with neutrophilia, which is consistent with cholecystitis.  Elevated glucose may be due to stress response or underlying diabetes.  Lipase is normal, making pancreatitis less likely.  Amylase and troponin are still needed to complete the workup. An abdominal ultrasound is necessary to visualize the gallbladder and assess for the presence of gallstones or other abnormalities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show leukocytosis with neutrophilia, which is consistent with cholecystitis.  Elevated glucose may be due to stress response or underlying diabetes.  Lipase, amylase, and troponin are within normal limits, making pancreatitis and myocardial infarction less likely. An abdominal ultrasound is necessary to visualize the gallbladder and assess for the presence of gallstones or other abnormalities.
Action: imaging
Action Input: RUQ ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound):  EXAMINATION: LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  TECHNIQUE: Grey scale and color Doppler ultrasound images of the abdomen were obtained.  FINDINGS: LIVER: The hepatic parenchyma appears within normal limits. The contour of the liver is smooth. There is no focal liver mass. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is no ascites.  BILE DUCTS: There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. The CBD measures 6 mm.  GALLBLADDER: The gallbladder contains a 2.0 cm gallstone, and mobile sludge. There is no wall edema or pericholecystic fluid to suggest acute ____.  PANCREAS: Imaged portion of the pancreas appears within normal limits, without masses or pancreatic ductal dilation, with portions of the pancreatic tail obscured by overlying bowel gas.  SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 9.4 cm.  KIDNEYS: The right kidney measures 10.0 cm. The left kidney measures 9.8 cm. Limited views demonstrate no stone or hydronephrosis.  RETROPERITONEUM: Visualized portions of aorta and IVC are within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a ___ with a history of recurrent symptomatic cholelithiasis presenting with acute RUQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and chills.  Labs showed leukocytosis and elevated glucose.  RUQ ultrasound confirms the presence of gallstones and sludge in the gallbladder without signs of acute cholecystitis. The CBD is not dilated. The pancreas, liver, spleen, and kidneys appear normal on the ultrasound.  The patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with biliary colic.
Action: done

Treatment: Admit the patient for supportive care, including intravenous fluids, pain management with NSAIDs or opioids, and antiemetics.  Initiate NPO status. Consult surgery for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  If surgery is delayed, consider starting antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., ceftriaxone and metronidazole).
