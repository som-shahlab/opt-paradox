HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ is a ___ w/ hypertension, hyperlipidemia who  presents with acute onset abdominal pain.  Patient was in her USOH until approx. 9PM last night, when she  suddenly developed severe ___ abdominal pain,  non-radiating. This was associated with one episode of  non-bloody emesis. Her pain persisted until she came to the ED  and received one dose of morphine approx. 2AM. Currently she  denies pain. She otherwise denies CP, palpitations, SOB,  diarrhea, headaches.  She did not eat anything unusual for dinner, and only had some  ensure. No sick contacts, no fevers/chills. She has never had  such a pain beforehand.  She had a chest x-ray that showed potentially small left lower  lobe infiltrate versus pneumonitis. RUQ U/S showed some CBD  dilation to 8mm, as well as cholelithiasis w/o signs of  cholecystitis. CT abdomen pelvis showed moderate intrahepatic  and extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. In the ED she was  given one dose of pip-tazo, and GI-ERCP was consulted.   ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives as noted in the HPI.  10-point review of systems were negative.   Past Medical History: PMH: -HTN -HLD  PSH: -no prior surgeries   Social History: ___ Family History: Cancer in both parents- ?gastric


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain and biliary ductal dilation. Given her history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, it's important to rule out cardiovascular causes and also investigate the biliary system further. The sudden onset of severe abdominal pain warrants a thorough evaluation to determine the etiology.
Action: laboratory tests

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with acute abdominal pain, elevated lipase, and biliary ductal dilation suggests gallstone pancreatitis. The elevated WBC count, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, BUN, and creatinine further support this diagnosis and indicate potential inflammation and some level of biliary obstruction.  The normal troponin and lactic acid help rule out cardiac ischemia.  The absence of amylase result is not ideal, but given the significantly elevated lipase, the diagnosis of pancreatitis remains highly probable.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought:This patient presents with acute severe abdominal pain, elevated lipase, conjugated bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase, along with biliary ductal dilation on imaging. This points towards gallstone pancreatitis as the primary diagnosis. The elevated WBC count further supports the presence of inflammation and infection. Choledocholithiasis is likely contributing to the pancreatitis by obstructing the common bile duct. Cholangitis is also a possibility given the elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, although the absence of fever makes it less likely. Acute cholecystitis should also be considered, although the ultrasound did not show signs of cholecystitis. While the patient has a family history of cancer, the acute nature of her presentation and the laboratory findings make malignancy less likely.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Gallstone pancreatitis
2. Choledocholithiasis
3. Cholangitis
4. Acute cholecystitis
5. Pancreatic malignancy

Treatment:
* NPO status initially, with gradual advancement to a low-fat diet as tolerated.
* IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte management.
* Pain control with analgesics (e.g., morphine, hydromorphone).
* ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone extraction to relieve biliary obstruction.
* Cholecystectomy should be considered after the acute pancreatitis resolves to prevent recurrence.
* Monitor vital signs, laboratory values (lipase, amylase, bilirubin, liver function tests, WBC count), and clinical status for improvement or complications.
* Antibiotics should be considered if there is evidence of cholangitis or infected pancreatic necrosis.
