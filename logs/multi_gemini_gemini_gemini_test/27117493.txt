HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man who developed sudden-onset right sided abdominal pain starting last night. Reports three nonbloody, brown, formed bowel movements, partially forced to  try to relieve pain. His symptoms have been associated with nausea, but no frank vomiting. Patient states he had some relief from standing in the shower. Pain has been in the RLQ since it  started without radiation anywhere else in the abdomen.     Past Medical History: shingles    Social History: ___ Family History: unknown


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of sudden-onset right lower quadrant pain with associated nausea and changes in bowel habits raises suspicion for appendicitis.  The reported relief with a hot shower could suggest a different etiology, but appendicitis cannot be ruled out.  A physical exam is necessary to evaluate for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on McBurney's point tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign,  rectal exam

ToolMessage:
"EXAM: physical  upon admission:  ___:  VS - 98.2 74 130/82 20 98%RA GEN - NAD, awake/alert HEENT - NCAT, EOMI, MMM, no scleral icterus ___ - RRR PULM - CTAB, no resp distress ABD - soft, nondistended; focal RLQ TTP without rebound or guarding EXTREM - warm, well-perfused  Physical examination"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The physical exam reveals focal right lower quadrant tenderness without rebound or guarding. This finding further increases the suspicion for appendicitis, although other diagnoses such as cecal diverticulitis or mesenteric adenitis are still possible.  Imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for other potential causes of abdominal pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. The only available imaging study is an ultrasound of the appendix."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the focal RLQ tenderness and the lack of rebound or guarding on physical exam, appendicitis remains high on the differential.  While a CT scan is preferred for evaluating appendicitis, an ultrasound of the appendix is a reasonable alternative, especially in younger patients or those where minimizing radiation exposure is a priority.  I will proceed with the ultrasound.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Ultrasound of the appendix

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested ultrasound of the appendix. Here is the complete report:  US APPENDIX (Ultrasound):  EXAMINATION: US APPENDIX  TECHNIQUE: Grey scale and color Doppler ultrasound images of the right lower quadrant were obtained at site of patient's symptoms.  FINDINGS: Mildly distended 7-8 mm noncompressible tubular structure extending off of the cecum with a large shadowing stone at the origin is at site of patient's symptoms. The distal end of the structure is not identified. Small amount of adjacent free fluid seen. No significant hyperemia. Mildly irregular wall is present. Stool is seen within this tubular structure."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The ultrasound demonstrates a mildly distended, noncompressible appendix with a large appendicolith at the base and surrounding free fluid.  These findings are highly suggestive of acute appendicitis. The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and ultrasound results all point towards appendicitis as the diagnosis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The ultrasound findings of a mildly distended, noncompressible appendix measuring 7-8mm with a large shadowing stone at the origin and adjacent free fluid are highly suggestive of acute appendicitis with appendicolith. The presence of an appendicolith significantly increases the risk of perforation. The irregular wall also raises concern for inflammation and possible early perforation.  The lack of significant hyperemia on ultrasound does not rule out appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis with Appendicolith
2. Cecal Diverticulitis
3. Mesenteric Adenitis
4. Epiploic Appendagitis
5. Typhlitis

Treatment:  The patient should be started on intravenous fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin, Ertapenem, or Piperacillin/Tazobactam).  Given the presence of an appendicolith and concerning ultrasound findings, a surgical consultation for an appendectomy should be obtained promptly.  Pain management should be provided with opioid analgesics.  The patient should be kept NPO in preparation for surgery.  Continuous monitoring of vital signs and symptoms is essential.
