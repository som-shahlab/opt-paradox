HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a healthy ___ who presents to the hospital with a chief complaint of abdominal pain. She noticed that for the last ___ weeks she has been having intermittent LLQ. The pain sometimes migrates to the mid lower and right lower abdomen as well. When the pain appears it usually lasts for ___ days and then subsides on its own. She tried taking Tylenol and Advil but that did not appear to relieve her symptoms. A couple of weeks ago the pain had increased in severity it was (___), lasted ___ days, and it was associated with a low grade fever to 100.3F. Given these symptoms she saw her PCP on ___ who recommended a CT scan of her abdomen and pelvis. That was performed today at  an OSH and the patient subsequently presented to ___ for further management.   Of note during her visit with her PCP she also complained of feeling that she was not able to empty her bladder completely. These symptoms had been present for the last 6 months to ___ year. For this reason a UA was sent that came back positive. She was placed on Macrobid treatment.   She denies weight loss, nausea, vomiting, or changes in her appetite. Last bowel movement was today and it was of normal caliber and consistency. Patient had a colonoscopy ___ years  ago and she was told that it was normal   Past Medical History: Migraines  Past Surgical History: 1) Left knee arthroscopy in ___ 2) Bilateral tubal ligation many years ago    Social History: ___ Family History: Father with diverticulitis and ?colon cancer

Thought: The patient presents with LLQ pain, which could indicate several conditions like diverticulitis, ovarian cysts, or even appendicitis (though less likely given the intermittent and migratory nature). The incomplete bladder emptying and positive UA suggest a possible UTI, which could also contribute to abdominal discomfort. The CT scan results are crucial to understanding the cause of her pain.  I need to review the CT scan and may need additional tests depending on the findings.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT scan of abdomen and pelvis (already performed, requesting results)

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report that was requested:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: SECOND OPINION CT TORSO:  TECHNIQUE: Single phase contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP: 371.82 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Extensive diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon is noted, without evidence of wall thickening or fat stranding. There is a low-density collection at the tip of the appendix measuring 1.6 cm x 1.4 cm with surrounding inflammatory changes of the fat and mesentery concerning for tip ____ with adjacent abscess formation (series 2: Image 57, series 601: Image 46). There is no extraluminal locules of air. The appendix more proximally is unremarkable and the base of the cecum is within normal limits.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Degenerative changes, most extensive fat of L4-L5.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the presence of appendicitis with an adjacent abscess.  The patient's symptoms, including LLQ pain migrating to the lower abdomen, fever, and the CT findings, strongly support this diagnosis. While the patient also has extensive diverticulosis, there are no signs of active diverticulitis on the CT. The patient's report of incomplete bladder emptying and positive UA likely indicate a UTI, which should be treated, but it's unlikely to be the primary cause of her current abdominal pain.  Given the findings of appendicitis with abscess, I would recommend surgical consultation.

The patient should be admitted for pain management, intravenous fluids, and close monitoring.  Surgical consultation should be obtained immediately.
