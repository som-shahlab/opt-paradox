HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Pt woke up with central abdominal pain @ 3 am, pain did not   get better with eating or taking tums, pain progressively gotten    worse with severe tenderness in RLQ. It was not asso with Nausea    vomitting or diarrhea. He had no preexisting GI or GU symptoms.    No constitutional symptoms. No h/o IBD. No recent travel.On   Amoxicillin for recent tooth extraction     Past Medical History: recent wisom teeth extraction


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of central abdominal pain migrating to the RLQ with progressive worsening and tenderness raises suspicion for appendicitis.  Given the lack of other GI symptoms and the recent antibiotic use, it's important to rule out other potential causes like a gynecological issue (if female), a urinary tract issue, or an atypical presentation of a gastrointestinal infection.  A physical exam is necessary to assess for peritoneal signs and other relevant findings.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on RLQ tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, McBurney's point tenderness, Obturator sign, Psoas sign;  Evaluation for Murphy's sign;  Genital exam (if female);  Vital signs including temperature, pulse, and blood pressure

ToolMessage:
"On admission:  Temp 99.4   Pulse 121    BP  167/89    RR 18    SATS 100 RA General cooperative, not in distress NEURO Oriented awake alert, no global or local deficits. HEENT  no thyromegaly, no lymphadenopathy, no carotid bruit. CHEST clear bilaterally CARDIAC S1 S2 audible no murmurs appreciated. ABDOMEN Localized Tenderness RLQ , non distended, BS+, guarding  + rebound + no herniation, no masses  EXTREM No edema, distal pulses palpable +2"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical exam findings of localized RLQ tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, and elevated pulse and temperature further increase the suspicion for appendicitis.  While the patient is not in acute distress, the presence of peritoneal signs warrants further investigation.  Imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast matches the available imaging studies. Here is the combined report:  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis after administration of 130 mL IV Optiray contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats are displayed.  FINDINGS: Lung bases are clear without nodule, mass or pleural effusion. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis or hydroureter. The non-opacified stomach and intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are unremarkable. The appendix is fluid-filled measuring up to 1 cm with wall edema. There is periappendiceal fluid. Findings are compatible with acute ____. The remainder of the large bowel is unremarkable. There is no free air in the abdomen. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is noted meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  There is a small amount of free fluid around the tip of the appendix. The urinary bladder, distal ureters, seminal vesicles, prostate, sigmoid colon, and rectum are unremarkable. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion is identified."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, demonstrating a fluid-filled appendix with wall edema and periappendiceal fluid.  The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and imaging results are all consistent with this diagnosis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, showing a fluid-filled appendix measuring up to 1 cm with wall edema and periappendiceal fluid. The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and imaging results all point towards this diagnosis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Typhlitis
3. Mesenteric adenitis
4. Right Ovarian Cyst (if female)
5. Right ureteral calculus

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for laparoscopic appendectomy.  Administer IV fluids for hydration.  Administer analgesics for pain management (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone).  Administer pre-operative antibiotics (e.g., Cefoxitin or Cefazolin plus metronidazole).  Post-operative care should include wound care, pain management, and monitoring for complications such as infection or abscess formation.
