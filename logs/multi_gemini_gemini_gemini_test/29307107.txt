Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
HPI: Mrs. ___ is a ___ year-old female with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, nephrolithiasis s/p open surgical removal on the left presenting with abdominal pain that started yesterday  night. She reports that yesterday evening at approximately 9PM she developed sudden onset of epigastric pain with nausea but no vomiting.  The pain was sharp, intermittent, with some radiation to the back, and no association to PO intake or activity.  It continue to progress in waves and she presented to the emergency room by approximately 1030PM.  The pain at that time had resolved, however, returned 15 minutes after being in the emergency room.  She continued to have nausea but no vomiting.  At the peak of her pain, she did have shortness-of-breath.  In the emergency room, she was treated for presumed chest pain with morphine, aspirin and nitro.  Her pain improved but has continued to be persistent in the epigastric region.  She still has some mild nausea but has not vomited.  She continues to have flatus with her last bowel movement yesterday morning.  She recalls that this is not the first time she has had pain of this nature, however, the previous episodes have not been at this level of intensity.  This similar pain has started approximately ___ years ago.  She has no fevers or chills.    Past Medical History: HTN, hyperlipidemia, Bilateral cataracts, Constipation    Social History: ___ Family History: nc


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with sudden epigastric pain radiating to the back, along with nausea and shortness of breath, raises suspicion for several conditions, including acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis, myocardial infarction, peptic ulcer disease, and even potentially a reoccurrence of nephrolithiasis.  Given her history of nephrolithiasis, it's important to investigate whether this episode is related to a new stone or other renal issues.  Her history of HTN and hyperlipidemia also puts her at higher risk for cardiovascular events.  To differentiate between these possibilities, I need more information about her current condition and vital signs, as well as laboratory and imaging studies.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's significantly elevated lipase and amylase, along with her presenting symptoms of epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, and prior history of similar pain, strongly suggest acute pancreatitis. The elevated WBC count and neutrophils are also consistent with this diagnosis.  The elevated ALT and AST may indicate some liver involvement or stress, possibly due to the pancreatitis. The normal troponin makes an acute MI unlikely. The urinalysis does not suggest any kidney stones or infection. I believe I have enough information to make a diagnosis.
