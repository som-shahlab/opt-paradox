InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, significantly elevated lipase, and a recent history of ERCP with stent placement, suggesting post-ERCP pancreatitis. Given her complex medical history including adrenal mass, it's crucial to differentiate the causes of abdominal pain and rule out other complications.  It's also important to assess her current hemodynamic stability and pain level.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has confirmed post-ERCP pancreatitis with a lipase of 5920.  Her bilirubin is also elevated, likely due to the known CBD stricture and stone.  She also has new anemia which is concerning given her history of weight loss and concerning for a possible GI bleed or malignancy.  The elevated CRP suggests significant inflammation. The low lymphocytes and monocytes are likely secondary to stress response.  Given her history of adrenal mass and subclinical Cushing's, it's important to consider the impact of steroids on her presentation and recovery. I have enough information to make a plan.
