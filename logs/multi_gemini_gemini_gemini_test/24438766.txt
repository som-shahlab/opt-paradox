Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mrs. ___ presents to the ED with 48 hours of acute abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, leukocytosis to ___ and clinical and radiological findings consistent with acute perforated appendicits. She is being seeing in consultation by ___ for furtehr management.  Her past medical history is pertinent for hypertension, hypothyroidism, endometriosis, migraines and recent laparoscopic left ovarian cystectomy and cystoscopy.   She was in her usual state of health until 2 days ago when she started feeling nauseated in AM. Her symptoms progressively worsened since with complains of diffuse abdominal pain, emesis, anorexia, and fever to 103. Her last BM was 2 days ago but still passing flatus. She endorses dysuria.     Past Medical History: Past Medical History: As above. Endometriosis, hypothyroidism  Past Surgical History: - ___: hysteroscopy, polypectomy, myomectomy, dilation  and curettage, insertion of Mirena IUD, laparoscopic left ovarian cystectomy and cystoscopy   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's presentation with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, leukocytosis, and clinical and radiological findings consistent with acute perforated appendicitis, it's crucial to gather information to determine the severity of the perforation and potential complications, as well as assess her overall health status before surgery.  Specifically, I need to know the degree of leukocytosis, the precise radiological findings, and evaluate her current hemodynamic stability and hydration status.  Additionally, understanding her thyroid status is important for perioperative management.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a clinical picture consistent with perforated appendicitis.  The lab results show leukocytosis with neutrophilia, hypokalemia, and abnormal urinalysis with proteinuria, ketonuria, hematuria, and bacteriuria.  The elevated glucose is likely due to the stress response.  The combination of abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and radiological findings strongly supports the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis.  The urinalysis findings may suggest a urinary tract infection, which could be concomitant or secondary to the appendicitis.  Given the available information, I am ready to provide my final assessment.
