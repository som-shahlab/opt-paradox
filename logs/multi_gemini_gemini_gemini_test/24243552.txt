HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Pt is a ___ with history of cholelithiasis who presents with two month history of intermittent RUQ pain and nausea following meals, which this morning became more severe and constant.  Her pain this morning was in the RUQ radiating toward R flank area and persistent, and she has had nausea all day and hence been unable to eat.  She denies vomiting.  She has not had any documented fevers, but was 99.2 at her PCP's office this morning, after which she was referred to the ___ ED for  further evaluation.  She has been passing flatus and having normal bowel movements without diarrhea or constipation.  Denies dysuria or hematuria.    Past Medical History: PMH: Positive PPD (treated with incomplete course) Elevated LFTs ___ (ultrasound showed gallstones)  PSH: None    Social History: ___ Family History: non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation suggests a possible biliary colic or cholecystitis, given her history of cholelithiasis and symptoms of RUQ pain radiating to the right flank, nausea, and low-grade fever.  However, other diagnoses such as pancreatitis, hepatitis, or even pyelonephritis need to be considered. I need more information to narrow down the diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show a mildly elevated ALT and moderate leukocytes in the urine, but no other significant abnormalities.  The normal lipase and amylase make pancreatitis less likely. The elevated ALT could be related to gallbladder disease or other liver conditions.  The leukocytes in urine raise the possibility of a urinary tract infection, although other urinary findings are normal.  An abdominal ultrasound would be helpful to assess the gallbladder and other abdominal organs.
Action: imaging
Action Input: RUQ ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested RUQ ultrasound matches the LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) study that is available. Here is the complete report:  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormality. Limited views of the right kidney are normal. Shadowing stones are seen within the gallbladder without gallbladder dilatation, wall edema, or pericholecystic fluid. Sonographic ___ sign was negative. The common duct is not dilated, measuring 3 mm. The spleen is normal measuring 7.8 cm. The pancreas is not well visualized due to overlying bowel gas."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with a history of cholelithiasis presenting with RUQ pain radiating to the right flank, nausea, and low-grade fever.  Labs showed a mildly elevated ALT and moderate leukocytes in urine.  RUQ ultrasound showed shadowing stones within the gallbladder without gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, or common bile duct dilation.  The sonographic Murphy's sign was negative.  These findings suggest biliary colic rather than acute cholecystitis. The mildly elevated ALT may be related to chronic cholelithiasis. The moderate leukocytes in urine could indicate a subclinical urinary tract infection, but given the lack of other urinary symptoms or findings, it is less likely to be clinically significant in this setting.  The absence of fever, significant leukocytosis, and other signs of systemic inflammation further supports the diagnosis of biliary colic.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought:The patient's presentation, labs, and ultrasound findings are consistent with symptomatic cholelithiasis (gallstones causing symptoms). The ultrasound confirms the presence of gallstones and the absence of acute cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), as there is no gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, or positive sonographic Murphy's sign. The mildly elevated ALT may be related to the gallstones. The leukocytes in the urine could indicate a subclinical urinary tract infection or may be unrelated to her current symptoms. Given her persistent pain and inability to eat, surgical intervention is warranted.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Symptomatic Cholelithiasis
2. Chronic Cholecystitis
3. Biliary Dyskinesia
4. Subclinical Urinary Tract Infection
5. Hepatitis

Treatment:  The patient should be admitted for intravenous hydration, pain control with NSAIDs or opioids, and antiemetics as needed. A surgical consultation should be obtained for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Prophylactic antibiotics are typically not necessary in the absence of acute cholecystitis.  The patient should be encouraged to ambulate and consume a clear liquid diet as tolerated.  Repeat liver function tests and a urinalysis with culture can be performed to monitor for any changes.  The patient should be educated about the procedure and potential complications. Post-operatively, the patient should be monitored for complications such as bleeding, infection, and bile leak.  She should be discharged home on a regular diet as tolerated and advised to follow up with her surgeon for wound check and removal of any drains or staples.
