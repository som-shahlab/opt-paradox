HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ yo w/gallstones presents with RUQ and back pain that began  yesterday morning. Pt reports pain is bandlike, constant.  +Nausea, no emesis. No fever. Was able to eat PB&J sandwich  yesterday without change in pain. Was concerned that it was  related to her heart. Had been taking IBP for pain related to  recent fall, without relief of abd pain.  All other ROS negative   Past Medical History: HTN HLD Gallstones Right Eye Blindness due to possible prior CVA   Social History: ___ Family History: Son sudden cardiac death age ___. Other sons have stents, or are  on plavix Father w/MI


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right upper quadrant (RUQ) and back pain, which are concerning for biliary colic or other gallbladder-related pathology given her history of gallstones. The band-like and constant nature of the pain, along with nausea, further supports this. However, given her family history of sudden cardiac death and MI, cardiac causes need to be ruled out.  Her age and history of possible prior CVA also increase her risk for cardiac issues.  Additionally, the location of pain could also indicate pancreatitis or other gastrointestinal issues.  I need more information to differentiate between these possibilities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show significantly elevated lipase, suggestive of pancreatitis.  The markedly elevated AST and ALT, along with elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin, suggest biliary involvement, likely gallstone pancreatitis.  The leukocytosis with neutrophilia is consistent with an inflammatory process.  The low potassium may be due to vomiting or poor intake.  The negative troponin makes an acute coronary syndrome less likely.  While amylase was ordered, it was not available in the provided lab results.  However, given the other findings, I am confident in the diagnosis of gallstone pancreatitis.
