HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with h/o gastric bypass ___ years ago with 180 lb weight loss, h/o GIB ___ years ago who presents with LLQ abdominal pain, light colored stool  and dark colored urine x 5 days. He was in a general state of good health until one month ago when he developed occasional light headedness and diaphoresis. Then six days ago while in ___ he developed an episode of profuse diaphoresis. This resolved. The next day he developed LLQ abdominal pain after eating along with light colored stool and dark urine. Then on the day of presentation yesterday, he ate  cheese stick at 3 am and he developed persistent severe abdominal pain which prompted him to come to go to the ED in ___.  Upon presentation to ___ his Total bilirubin was 5.1, AlK Phosp = 260, ALT = 446.,AST = 197,direct bili = 4.04, lipase = 30,000, LDH = 236. He had an abdominal CT scan which demonstrated normal intra and extra-hepatic biliary ducts. Extensive peripancreatic inflammatory changes present. No calficication. CBD within pancreatic head normal.    His weight has been stable after his gastric bypass for more  than a year now.   Past Medical History: S/p gastric bypass ___ years ago GIB ___ years ago   Social History: ___ Family History: He is adopted and does not know his biological family's history. His son did have ___ issues" and is s/p CCY.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with symptoms suggestive of biliary obstruction (light stool, dark urine) and pancreatitis (abdominal pain, elevated lipase). However, the CT scan shows normal biliary ducts, raising the possibility of other causes for the elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes. Given the history of gastric bypass, it's crucial to investigate potential complications like afferent loop syndrome or gallstones. The recent onset of lightheadedness and diaphoresis also warrants further evaluation.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with abdominal pain, light stool, dark urine, and significantly elevated lipase points towards pancreatitis as the primary diagnosis. The elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes could be due to compression or inflammation of the biliary tree secondary to the pancreatitis. The normal biliary ducts on CT scan rule out gallstones or other obstructive causes within the ducts themselves.  The lack of calcifications argues against chronic pancreatitis. The patient's history of gastric bypass surgery, while relevant, doesn't appear to be directly causing the current issue, although malnutrition could be a contributing factor. The recent episodes of lightheadedness and diaphoresis could be related to pain or other systemic effects of pancreatitis.  While some lab results are still pending (vitamin B12, folate, iron studies, HbA1c, urine analysis), I have enough information to make a reasonable clinical reasoning.
