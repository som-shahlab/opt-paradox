HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ F in ___ until yesterday when developed central abdominal  pain, described as crampy and dull.  This pain progressed in  intensity overnight as it migrated to the LUQ.  No fever, +  subjective chills, mild nausea, no emesis.  No prior  episodes.   Stooled this morning, looser-than-normal without melena nor  hematochezia.    Past Medical History: Hypothyroid, depression, migraines, laparoscopic cholecystectomy  (___), biliary colic, neurosurgery procedure for astrocytoma  (___)    Social History: ___ Family History: Celiac disease (sister), colon ca ___ grandfather),  alzheimers, osteoarthritis


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms of migrating abdominal pain, initially central and then localizing to the left upper quadrant (LUQ), along with subjective chills, nausea, and loose stool, raise concerns for several possible diagnoses including diverticulitis, pancreatitis, or even a perforated viscus. Given her history of cholecystectomy, it's less likely to be gallbladder-related, but biliary colic history suggests potential issues with the biliary tree.  To narrow down the possibilities, I need to assess for tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness in the abdomen, particularly in the LUQ.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on LUQ, including palpation for tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, Murphy's sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate

ToolMessage:
"96.8, 80, 110/60, 18, 98 on RA A&Ox3, NAD, sitting in stretcher in mild discomfort CTAB RRR Soft, ND, nl BS. focal area of moderate tenderness in LLQ, with  localized rebound. non-tender elsewhere with no  rebound/guarding. Rectal declined by patient because already  performed by ED personnel, reportedly guaiac negative. WWP sans C/C/E"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with migrating abdominal pain that has localized to the LUQ, along with subjective chills, nausea, and loose stool. While the initial presentation suggested several possibilities like diverticulitis, pancreatitis, or a perforated viscus, the physical exam findings reveal localized tenderness and rebound in the LLQ, which points towards diverticulitis as the most likely diagnosis.  The absence of fever argues against a more severe or systemic infection. The patient's past medical history of cholecystectomy and biliary colic, while relevant, are less likely to be directly related to the current LLQ findings.  Given the localized LLQ findings and lack of fever, I will proceed with imaging to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast matches the available CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST. Here is the full report:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Multiple MDCT axial images were obtained from the base of the lungs through the proximal thighs with intravenous but without enteric contrast. Multiplanar reformats were obtained.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized thorax, the lungs are clear. There is no pulmonary mass, pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The visualized heart is normal in size. There is no pericardial effusion. The esophagus was normal. In the abdomen, the liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenals appear normal. The kidneys symmetrically take up and excrete contrast without hydronephrosis. There has been a cholecystectomy. There is soft tissue density about a focal portion of the descending colon at the splenic flexure (series 2, image 40; series 300B, image 38) with demonstration of a diverticulum. There is no pathologic retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber and course.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The anteverted uterus appears normal. An apparent loculated structure behind the pelvis is likely small bowel loops. There is no pelvic free air, free fluid, or pathologic lymphadenopathy.  MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with migrating abdominal pain, initially central and then localizing to the LUQ, accompanied by subjective chills, nausea, and loose stool.  Physical examination revealed localized tenderness and rebound tenderness in the LLQ.  The CT scan confirms the presence of a diverticulum in the descending colon at the splenic flexure with surrounding soft tissue density, consistent with diverticulitis.  The absence of free air, fluid, or abscess suggests uncomplicated diverticulitis.  The other abdominal organs appear normal on the CT scan.  The patient's history of cholecystectomy and biliary colic are incidental findings and not related to the current presentation.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Uncomplicated Diverticulitis
