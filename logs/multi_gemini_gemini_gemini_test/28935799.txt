HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ y/o F with s/p Mitral and Aortic mechanical valves  replacement for Rheumatic fever on coumadin, pulmonary  hypertension w/ Right heart failure and congestive liver  disease. Onset of pain 6 days ago with left flank pain seen in  ED by Urology at ___ diagnosed with non obstructive stone,  subsequently, sent home on Bactrim and flomax.  Associated nausea and vomiting for 2 days and later resolved.  Today, presents with worsening pain that migrated over the week  from midabdomen to RLQ. Her INR is 8 today (usually at range  ___ and is having episodes of nose bleed. She takes  intermittent doses of coumadin 2.5/3mg. She is having regular bowel movements and passing flatus.  Denies constipation, diarrhea, chest pain, SOB, urinary symtopms  ROS: All negative except for above.    Past Medical History: Redo-Aortic Valve Replacement (mechanical) h/o Rheumatic Heart Disease/Mitral Stenosis/Aortic Insufficiency  s/p Mitral Valve Replacement (mechanical) and Aortic Valve  Replacement (mechanical) ___ Pulmonary Hypertension Atrial Fibrillation Aortic insufficiency s/p  Mitral commissurotomy ___ Hypothyroid Urinary retention h/o atrial fibrillation Uterine Fibroids s/p Left oophorectomy, partial left salpingectomy   Social History: ___ Family History: No diabetes, hypertension, or coronary artery disease


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of mechanical valves, anticoagulation therapy, elevated INR, and abdominal pain migrating from the left flank to RLQ, several possibilities need to be considered.  The most concerning are retroperitoneal bleed, bowel ischemia/infarction, or even a complicated appendicitis.  Her prior diagnosis of a non-obstructive kidney stone could be a red herring. I need to assess her hemodynamic stability and abdominal status, and look for signs of bleeding elsewhere.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation;  Abdominal exam including inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation assessing for tenderness, guarding, rebound, rigidity, and masses;  Assessment of skin for pallor, ecchymosis, petechiae;  Evaluation for active bleeding including nosebleed, hematuria, rectal bleeding.

ToolMessage:
"Afebrile, HDS, VSS General: AOX3, NAD Neuro: no focal deficits HEENT: normocephalic atraumatic CV HDS, RRR, no murmurs Pulm: CTAB no wheezing GI: S/ Appropriate TTP/ non distended Extre: No edema or cyanosis"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is hemodynamically stable and afebrile, which is somewhat reassuring. The abdominal exam reveals tenderness but no other concerning findings like guarding, rebound, or rigidity.  However, given her elevated INR and history of anticoagulation, a retroperitoneal bleed remains a high concern.  The absence of other signs of bleeding is helpful but not definitive. I need imaging to assess for retroperitoneal bleeding and other intra-abdominal pathology.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"While there is a CT Abdomen and Pelvis study available in the list, it was performed without contrast, whereas the requested study is CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast. Therefore, the exact requested imaging study is not available in the provided list of studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The lack of IV contrast limits the utility of the CT scan in evaluating for retroperitoneal bleed.  While a non-contrast CT can detect some abnormalities, it is not sensitive enough to rule out a bleed. Given the high clinical suspicion and the patient's significant risk factors, I would proceed with a CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast despite the previous non-contrast study.  The potential benefits of detecting a significant bleed outweigh the small risk of contrast administration.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The closest matching study from the available list is \"CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST,\" but this is not exactly what was requested since the requested study specifically calls for IV contrast while the available study was performed without contrast. Here is the full report for the available study:  CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST (CT): TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis without IV or oral contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed. Total DLP is 460 mGy-cm. CTDIvol is 9 mGy.  FINDINGS: Lack of IV contrast limits evaluation of solid organs. The imaged lung bases are clear. The heart is severely enlarged. The liver is nodular in contour, in keeping with cirrhosis. There are large gallstones in the gallbladder which is otherwise unremarkable. There is a small amount of perihepatic ascites as well as ascites and haziness within the mesentery. The pancreas is grossly unremarkable. The spleen is normal. There are varices seen adjacent to the spleen. The left adrenal gland is mildly thickened. Right adrenal gland is normal. There is a 4 mm non-obstructing stone in the lower pole of the left kidney, unchanged. No hydronephrosis. The right kidney is normal. There are no ureteral stones identified. The stomach is normal. The small bowel is normal. There is no obstruction. The appendix is enlarged measuring 11 mm with surrounding stranding. The colon is unremarkable. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. No free air.  PELVIS: Uterus and adnexa are grossly unremarkable. The rectum is normal. The bladder is normal. There is small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There are clips in the right groin. The aorta is normal in caliber.  BONES: No suspicious osseous lesions are identified."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The non-contrast CT shows an enlarged appendix with surrounding stranding, suggesting appendicitis.  Given her elevated INR, a ruptured appendix would be a serious concern.  The report also mentions ascites and haziness within the mesentery, which could be related to her liver disease but could also represent blood in the peritoneal cavity.  The lack of contrast makes it difficult to definitively characterize these findings.  Despite the prior non-contrast CT, the possibility of a retroperitoneal or intraperitoneal bleed remains a significant concern given her clinical picture and extremely elevated INR.  The enlarged appendix raises the possibility of a ruptured appendix, which could be life-threatening in the context of her coagulopathy.  I need to reverse her coagulopathy and consult surgery immediately.
