HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with abdominal pain localized the RLQ since yesterday afternoon.  Pain constant and worsening since then.  No nausea  or vomiting.  Denies fever or chills.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: DM (diet controlled)  Past Surgical History: none    Social History: ___ Family History: non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with localized RLQ abdominal pain of increasing intensity, which is a concerning presentation for appendicitis.  While the lack of nausea, vomiting, fever, or chills argues against it, I need to gather more information to rule out appendicitis and other potential causes of RLQ pain like ovarian cysts or kidney stones.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign,  rebound tenderness, abdominal guarding,  assess for rigidity

ToolMessage:
"97.8  89  110/67  18  100RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: soft, non-distended, tender to palpation in RLQ, no  rebound, positive for voluntary guarding Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical exam reveals tenderness in the RLQ, voluntary guarding, but no rebound tenderness.  The lack of rebound tenderness and other peritoneal signs somewhat lowers the suspicion for appendicitis, but it doesn't rule it out completely, especially since the pain is worsening.  A CT scan would be helpful to visualize the appendix and rule out other causes of RLQ pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST report, which matches your request for CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast:  STUDY: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast; coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also generated.  FINDINGS:  ABDOMEN: The visualized portion of the heart and lungs appear unremarkable. The liver demonstrates no focal lesion or biliary dilatation. The gallbladder shows no wall thickening, stones or pericholecystic fluid. The spleen is normal in size and appearance. The pancreas is normal appearing. The adrenal glands appear normal bilaterally. The kidneys enhance with and excrete contrast symmetrically. Multiple subcentimeter hypodensities within the left kidney are most consistent with cysts, but are too small to completely characterize. The small and large intestine show no evidence of obstruction or wall thickening. No lymphadenopathy is seen. No free air or free fluid is noted.  PELVIS: The bladder and rectum appear unremarkable. A prostate calcification is noted. The appendix is identified, it measures up to 9 mm in diameter and is fluid filled distally. The appendiceal wall is hyperemic. There is also surrounding fat stranding in this area. There is no evidence of an abscess or extraluminal gas.  BONES: No concerning osteolytic or sclerotic lesions are seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, and while initial exam findings were not definitive, the CT scan confirms appendicitis with a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with a hyperemic wall and surrounding fat stranding.  This confirms the diagnosis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, and while initial findings were not definitive for appendicitis, the CT scan confirms the diagnosis. The CT report shows an enlarged, fluid-filled appendix with a hyperemic wall and surrounding fat stranding, all highly suggestive of appendicitis.  Given the patient's worsening pain and the CT findings, surgical intervention is warranted.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian cyst (less likely given normal pelvic findings on CT)

4. Pelvic inflammatory disease (less likely given lack of fever, vaginal discharge, or other suggestive symptoms)
5. Constipation (less likely given the severity and localized nature of the pain)

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy.  Consult surgical services for laparoscopic appendectomy.  Administer IV fluids for hydration.  Administer pre-operative antibiotics (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of metronidazole and ceftriaxone) to cover common bowel flora.  Provide pain control with IV analgesics.
