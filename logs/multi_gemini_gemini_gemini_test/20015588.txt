HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Pt is an ___ y.o female with no PMH who presented with ___,  formerly ___ crampy abdominal pain with radiation to the  pain. Pt reports nausea and vomiting prior to transfer and  yesterday. She reports that she has had this pain off/on during  her pregnancy but never this prolonged or severe. She was told  she had "reflux". However, day prior to admit, pt had 6hrs of  continuous epigastric pain with n/v that was new for pt. She  does report intermittent heartburn and chills but denies fever,  constipation, melena, brbpr, dysuria or changes in weight.  However, she does report decreased appetite with onset of these  symptoms. She denies CP, sob, palpitations, URI, rash. She  reports mild frontal headache, ___ similiar to prior without  paresthesias, weakness, blurred vision. She reports mild  non-productive cough x1 day without myalgias, arthralgias or  other URI symptoms. Pt initially presented to ___  and was given ceftriaxone per report prior to transfer. She does  report drinking "3 coronas ___ days ago". In the ED, vital signs  stable. She does report continued post-partum vaginal bleeding. 10 point ROS reviewed and pertinent for the above.   Past Medical History: s/p appy and tonsillectomy ovarian cyst   Social History: ___ Family History: "gallbladder issues and stones" with her uncle and cousins


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of crampy abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and previous dismissal as "reflux," it's crucial to differentiate between several possible diagnoses including, but not limited to, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, appendicitis (though she's had an appendectomy), bowel obstruction, and other gastrointestinal issues.  Her alcohol consumption and family history of gallbladder issues raise suspicion for biliary pathology.  Information about the location, character, and radiation of the pain, as well as the presence or absence of fever, and the nature of her post-partum bleeding are important.  A physical exam and basic labs are needed initially.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Complete abdominal exam including palpation for tenderness, guarding, rebound, and Murphy's sign;  assess bowel sounds; vital signs including temperature; evaluate post-partum bleeding (amount, color, odor).

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The physical exam reveals mild epigastric tenderness without guarding or rebound, which could point to several different diagnoses.  The patient's report of chills and mild cough, although she denies other URI symptoms, warrants investigation for possible infection. Given the family history of gallbladder issues, the alcohol consumption, and the persistent abdominal pain, biliary pathology remains a strong consideration. Pancreatitis and other GI issues are also possible. Laboratory tests are needed to help narrow the differential diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The significantly elevated lipase points strongly towards pancreatitis.  The slightly elevated AST is also consistent with this diagnosis.  While amylase would be helpful, the lipase is sufficient to make the diagnosis in conjunction with the clinical picture.  The patient's history of alcohol consumption is a likely contributing factor.  Her hemoglobin and hematocrit are low, likely due to post-partum bleeding, but should be monitored.  I have enough information to make a recommendation.
