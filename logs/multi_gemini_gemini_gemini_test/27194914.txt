Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ presents with 7 days of cramping abdominal pain localized to the RUQ and nausea and emesis that started 3 days ago. Ms. ___ awakened in the middle of the night on ___ with bilateral cramping abdominal pain in the hypogastrium, nausea, and nonbloody, non-bilious emesis. Over the subsequent  24 hours the pain localized to the RUQ, was constant, and was cramping in quality.This pain lasted only ___ hours per episode, however she had multiple episodes since last ___. However today the pain worsen and lasted longer then 4 hrs, hence she presented to the ED.She also complained of decreased appetite. She endorses chills without fever and ongoing  watery diarrhea, which not unusual for her. She denies syncope, SOB, CP sick contacts, dysuria, constipation, or weight changes. .

Thought: The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting, which could indicate several conditions, including cholecystitis, hepatitis, or pancreatitis.  Given her history of diverticulosis, diverticulitis is also a possibility, although less likely given the location of the pain.  To differentiate between these possibilities, I need to gather more information through laboratory tests and imaging.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, which suggests an inflammatory process.  The urinalysis shows large blood and protein, which is concerning for a kidney issue.  The normal lipase, amylase, AST, ALT, ALP, and bilirubin make pancreatitis, hepatitis, and biliary obstruction less likely. Given the RUQ pain, elevated WBC, and hematuria/proteinuria, I now suspect nephrolithiasis. An abdominal CT scan would help confirm this.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast is not available among the provided imaging studies. The available studies are a CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast and a liver/gallbladder ultrasound."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Since a CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast is not available, a CT with contrast is the next best option to evaluate for nephrolithiasis.  The liver/gallbladder ultrasound can also help assess for gallbladder pathology, although this is less likely given the normal liver function tests and the presence of hematuria and proteinuria.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast, liver/gallbladder ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"Both requested imaging studies are available. Since both are requested, I'll provide both reports:  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced axial images were obtained from the lung bases to pelvic outlet. Coronal and sagittal reformations are provided.  FINDINGS: Though this exam is not tailored for supradiaphragmatic evaluation, atelectatic changes are noted within the dependent lung bases. Heart size is normal without pericardial effusion.  CT ABDOMEN: The liver is homogeneous in attenuation without discrete masses or lesions. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is minimally distended with gallbladder wall edema evident, measuring up to 6 mm in diameter. There is also haziness of the adjacent fat. A 1.3-cm rounded radiopaque gallstone is noted within the neck of the gallbladder. The pancreas is overall unremarkable and without pancreatic duct dilatation. The spleen is normal. The bilateral adrenal glands have normal limb thickness and are without convex margin to suggest mass. The bilateral kidneys are normal in size and excrete contrast symmetrically. The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable. Diverticula are noted throughout the descending and sigmoid colon without associated inflammatory changes to suggest diverticulitis. There is no retroperitoneal, mesenteric or portacaval lymphadenopathy identified. There is no free or loculated fluid identified within the abdomen. There is no free air noted within the abdomen. Minimal atherosclerotic plaques are noted within the abdominal aorta without associated aneurysmal change. The ostia of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries are widely patent. The main portal vein and its major tributaries are unremarkable.  CT PELVIS: The rectum and bladder are unremarkable. Multiple rounded hypodensities are noted. Multiple hypodensities are noted within the uterus, likely representing fibroids. The adnexa are unremarkable. There is no pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy identified. There is no free fluid within the pelvis.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified.  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND: EXAM: Right upper quadrant ultrasound.  FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates normal, homogeneous echotexture without focal intrahepatic lesion seen. There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The gallbladder is not overly distended; however, evidence of cholelithiasis and sludge is seen. There is mild gallbladder wall thickening. No pericholecystic fluid is seen. Sonographic ___ sign is negative; however, the question is raised if patient is diabetic. Main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The common bile duct is normal in caliber measuring 0.3 cm in diameter. The pancreas is partially obscured by overlying bowel gas, although the visualized portion is unremarkable, without pancreatic ductal dilatation."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms, combined with the lab results and imaging findings, point to acute cholecystitis.  The CT scan reveals gallbladder wall edema, haziness of the adjacent fat, and a gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. The ultrasound confirms cholelithiasis, sludge, and mild gallbladder wall thickening.  The elevated white blood cell count further supports the diagnosis of an inflammatory process in the gallbladder.  While the urinalysis showed hematuria and proteinuria, the CT scan did not reveal any kidney stones or other abnormalities that would explain these findings.  The patient's history of diverticulosis was considered, but the CT scan did not show any signs of diverticulitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Cholecystitis
2. Nephrolithiasis
3. Diverticulitis
4. Hepatitis
5. Pancreatitis

Treatment:  The patient should be admitted for intravenous fluids, pain management, and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., ceftriaxone and metronidazole). A surgical consultation should be obtained for consideration of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  The patient's diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia should be managed medically.  Potassium supplementation should be considered given the low potassium level.
