Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr ___ is a ___ yo with ___ relevant for recent knee surgery  (___), seizure disorder, NIDDM, HTN  who was transferred  from ___ on ___ for concern of  cholangitis.  He is s/p knee surgery POD 10 with TKR at ___  on ___. He reports 3 day of decreased PO intake, decreased  urine output, nausea, fever to 101, and Right sided abdominal  pain. He was on coumadin after the TKR with INR 2.7 and as such  got 4u FFP with vitamin K and 8L of fluids at ___  ___ in the event a procedure was planned. RIJ triple lumen  was placed with 2x 20G peripheral IVs. His lactate there was 5.0  and there was concern for sepsis due to cholangitis. He was also  started on 4.5g of zosyn.   The patient was evaluated by interventional radiology who stated  they do  not feel comfortable doing a percutaneous gallbladder  with his INR that high. It was felt the patient needed timely  care and surgery at OSH did not want to do an open  cholecystectomy on a septic gentleman with borderline  hypotension and anticoagulated. Given there was no radiologist  at ___ to do a perc drain after INR trended down, he was  transferred to ___ and placed on norepinephrine at 0.05 for  transfer given hypotension.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a complex picture of possible cholangitis post-knee surgery, with coagulopathy and borderline hypotension. While there is imaging suggesting pericholecystitic fluid and gallbladder wall thickening, the lack of ductal dilatation raises questions about the etiology of the patient's symptoms. Given the recent knee surgery and coagulopathy, it's crucial to rule out other sources of infection and sepsis, such as a periprosthetic joint infection or other intra-abdominal process.  Additionally, the patient's electrolyte abnormalities (hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia) need further investigation. A thorough physical exam and additional laboratory tests are needed to clarify the diagnosis and guide management.

Thought: The patient's labs show a mixed picture.  The negative blood cultures and lack of leukocytosis in the urine argue against a systemic bacterial infection, although procalcitonin would be helpful if available. The elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin are consistent with cholestasis, but the lack of ductal dilatation on ultrasound makes simple obstruction less likely. The patient's coagulopathy is improving but still present. The hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatemia suggest significant electrolyte disturbances, possibly related to dehydration or the patient's recent aggressive fluid resuscitation.  The elevated protein and hyaline casts in the urine may indicate some degree of renal impairment, which could be contributing to the electrolyte abnormalities.  The patient's clinical picture, including fever, right-sided abdominal pain, and nausea, still points towards a possible biliary process.  Given the persistent concern for cholangitis despite the lack of clear obstruction, and the complex interplay of electrolyte abnormalities and coagulopathy, I would proceed with imaging to better visualize the biliary tree and surrounding structures.
