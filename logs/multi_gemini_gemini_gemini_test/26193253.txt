HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with history of atrial fibrillation on  warfarin, cerebrovascular accident, gastrointestinal bleed, and  cholecystectomy who initially presented to ___  with abdominal and back pain, now transferred for further  evaluation in the setting of elevated lipase and liver function  tests. She was in her usual state of health until 3 to 4 days  prior to admission, when she developed sudden onset "burning"  back pain with associated epigastric pain, nonpostprandial and  exacerbated by lying in bed. She endorses poor oral intake over  the same period, but denies fever, chills, sweats, or  nausea/vomiting. She also reports reports small volume epistaxis  on the day of admission that resolved spontaneously.    On the day of admission, she was seen by her primary care  provider, who noted that she was jaundiced and referred her to  the ___ ED. At ___, labs  were significant for ALT of 157, AST of 213, AlkP of 398, lipase  of 551, TBili of 6.1 (4.2 direct), INR of 11.3, Wbc of 11.3, Hct  of 41.7, and platelets of 222. Right upper quadrant ultrasound  revealed intra- and extrahepatic biliary dilatation with common  bile duct of 19.8mm from 15mm in ___. She was given  piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375g IV and vitamin K 5mg PO.     In the ___ ED, initial vital signs were as follows: 98.3 82  149/73 20 95% 4L. Labs significant for Ca of 10.6, ALT of 186,  AST of 277, TBili of 8.5, lipase of 831, albumin of 3.8, Wbc of  9.7, INR of 12, and UA with gross/microscopic hematuria. CXR  demonstrated questionable RLL infiltrate. CT abdomen/pelvis  revealed biliary dilatation without clear focus of obstruction,  as well as simple free fluid in the stomach and along the liver.  The ERCP service was consulted and advised 2 units FFP and  vitamin K 5mg IV in anticipation of ERCP the following day if  coagulopathy effectively reversed.    On the floor, she is comfortable without chills, sweats, nausea,  or vomiting.     Past Medical History: Atrial fibrillation on warfarin   Cerebrovascular accident  Gastrointestinal bleed Status post cholecystectomy   Peripheral neuropathy   Hypertension   Hyperlipidemia Coronary artery disease (occluded RCA with left to right  collaterals)   Nonocclusive carotid stenosis   Chronic venous insufficiency   Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Obstructive sleep apnea   Status post hysterectomy   Diverticulitis status post partial bowel resection   Social History: ___ Family History: Cerebrovascular accidents in multiple family members.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal and back pain, elevated lipase and liver function tests, and biliary dilatation. The differential diagnosis includes pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis, and cholangitis.  Given her history of atrial fibrillation on warfarin and elevated INR, it's crucial to assess her coagulation status and manage it appropriately before considering invasive procedures like ERCP. I also need to understand the cause of the hematuria and the potential RLL infiltrate.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has significantly elevated INR, PT, and PTT, indicating a severe coagulopathy, likely due to her warfarin therapy.  She also has elevated lipase, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin, suggesting pancreatitis and biliary obstruction. The thrombocytopenia and hematuria may be related to the coagulopathy.  The elevated neutrophils could indicate an inflammatory or infectious process.  While the patient is currently comfortable, her condition could rapidly deteriorate.  Given the lab results and clinical picture, I believe I have enough information to make a reasonable diagnostic impression.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Pancreatitis likely secondary to Choledocholithiasis
2. Cholangitis
3. Warfarin-induced Coagulopathy
4. Upper Gastrointestinal Bleed
5. Right Lower Lobe Pneumonia

Treatment:
1. **Reverse Warfarin Coagulopathy:** Administer Vitamin K 10mg IV now and repeat every 12 hours as needed.  Administer 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) or fresh frozen plasma (FFP) as per institutional protocol to rapidly reverse the INR.  Monitor INR closely.
2. **Fluid Resuscitation:** Initiate intravenous fluids (e.g., Lactated Ringer's) to maintain adequate hydration and electrolyte balance.
3. **Pain Management:** Provide adequate pain control with intravenous opioids (e.g., hydromorphone) while avoiding morphine due to its potential to cause sphincter of Oddi spasm.
4. **Biliary Drainage:** Once the INR is sufficiently corrected (ideally <1.5), urgent ERCP should be performed to relieve biliary obstruction and evaluate for choledocholithiasis.  If stones are found, they should be removed during the ERCP.  Consider placement of a biliary stent if complete stone removal is not possible.
5. **Antibiotics:**  Given the possibility of cholangitis, initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics with coverage for biliary pathogens (e.g., Piperacillin/Tazobactam or Ceftriaxone plus Metronidazole).
6. **Respiratory Evaluation:**  Obtain a chest X-ray and consider a chest CT to further evaluate the questionable RLL infiltrate.  If pneumonia is confirmed, initiate appropriate antibiotic therapy.
7. **Gastrointestinal Bleed Evaluation:**  Monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit closely.  Perform a nasogastric lavage to assess for active bleeding.  If significant bleeding is suspected, consult gastroenterology for upper endoscopy.
8. **Supportive Care:**  Provide supplemental oxygen as needed.  Monitor vital signs, electrolytes, and renal function.  Initiate deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis once the coagulopathy is reversed.  Provide nutritional support as tolerated, initially with NPO and then advancing to a low-fat diet as symptoms improve.
9. **Close Monitoring:**  Closely monitor the patient for signs of clinical deterioration, including worsening abdominal pain, fever, hypotension, or altered mental status.
