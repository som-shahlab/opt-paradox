HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___. male p/w acute onset RUQ pain starting at 1am on ___ (3  days ago).  Denies fever, nausea, and vomiting.  Reports  anorexia since then.  Pain has been controlled with Tylenol.  He  did present to ___ where RUQ US and CT abdomen  showed sludge in the gallbladder and he was discharged home.   His symptoms persisted, with fever to 101 last night, and he was referred to the ED by Dr. ___   ___ Medical History: HLD, ADHD   Social History: ___ Family History: father s/p cholecystectomy


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain, anorexia, and fever concerning for cholecystitis.  While imaging showed sludge, the development of fever is a concerning sign. I need to gather more information to assess the patient's current status and rule out other diagnoses.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: RUQ tenderness, Murphy's sign, vital signs (heart rate, temperature, blood pressure, respiratory rate)

ToolMessage:
"ADMISSION EXAM: T: 97.4  P: 68  BP: 115/67  RR: 16  O2sat: 97% on RA General: awake, alert, oriented x 3, NAD HEENT: NCAT, EOMI, anicteric Heart: RRR Lungs: normal excursion, no respiratory distress Back: no vertebral tenderness, no CVA tenderness Abdomen: soft, RUQ tenderness, ___ sign, ND, ~3 cm umbilical hernia Extremities: WWP, no CCE, no tenderness, 2+ B radial pulses Psychiatric: normal judgment/insight, normal memory, normal mood/affect"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain, anorexia, and fever concerning for cholecystitis.  The initial ultrasound and CT scan showed gallbladder sludge, and the patient subsequently developed a fever.  Physical exam reveals RUQ tenderness and a positive Murphy's sign, further supporting the diagnosis of cholecystitis.  Given the patient's history, physical exam findings, and prior imaging, I have enough information to make a clinical reasoning.
