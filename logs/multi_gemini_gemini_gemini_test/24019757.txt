Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old male with history of alcoholism, HTN, new diagnosis  of diabetes here with 2 weeks of generalized weakness, malaise,  and 1 week of vomiting and diarrhea. Reports at recent PCP  appointment was told he might be diabetic but has not started  any meds. Went to urgent care on ___ where he was given  zofran and cyclobenzabrine for abdominal cramping and told that  he had the flu. He denies ever having a flu swab. The patient  has not had any tamiflu. The patient says that on 1 day prior to  admission he was unable to walk to the bathroom without becoming  extremely exhausted. The patient called his PCP on ___  morning and was told to come to the emergency room. Of note the  patient's creatinine on ___ was 0.8. Patient increased  his Lisinopril from 10mg to 20mg on the ___.   On arrival to the ED the patient was found to have vitals of 0  97.5 88 77/44 16 92% RA. Patient bolused fluids and his blood  pressure improved. The patient's labs were significant for a  transaminitis, Cr of 6.2, Na of 129 and hyperbilirubinemia of  2.1. The patient was seen by the GI team. US showed mild  dilation in bile duct, but no active signs of cholecystitis.   On arrival to the floor patient's vitals were 97.8 110/60 85 18  94 RA. Patient was anxious but not in acute distress.    Review of systems:   (+) Per HPI   (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or  gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or  congestion. Denies cough, shortness of breath. Denies chest pain  or tightness, palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or  bladder habits. No dysuria. Denies arthralgias or myalgias.      Past Medical History: Chronic  HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA  BPH  HYPERTENSION - ESSENTIAL, BENIGN  FATTY LIVER  ESOPHAGEAL REFLUX  Sleep apnea  Alcoholism  Type 2 diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled     Social History: ___ Family History: Father passed away of bladder cancer

Thought: The patient presents with acute kidney injury (AKI) in the setting of generalized weakness, malaise, vomiting, and diarrhea.  The recent increase in lisinopril, along with dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea, could have contributed to the AKI.  His history of alcoholism, hypertension, and newly diagnosed uncontrolled diabetes are also relevant.  Given the transaminitis and hyperbilirubinemia, further investigation of liver function is warranted.  It's important to differentiate between pre-renal, intrinsic, and post-renal causes of AKI and to assess the severity of his liver dysfunction.  The patient's electrolyte disturbances (hyponatremia) also need to be addressed.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show acute kidney injury, thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, elevated lipase, elevated CK, hyperbilirubinemia, and lactic acidosis.  The urine studies suggest intrinsic kidney injury.  The negative hepatitis panel makes viral hepatitis less likely.  The elevated lipase suggests pancreatitis, which could be contributing to the patient's overall clinical picture.  The elevated CK could be due to rhabdomyolysis, which could also contribute to AKI.  The combination of AKI, thrombocytopenia, and altered mental status raises concern for thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).  While we have ruled out viral hepatitis, alcoholic hepatitis remains a possibility given his history of alcoholism.  The patient's history of recently increasing his lisinopril dosage, combined with dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea, likely precipitated his AKI.  I have enough information to make a differential diagnosis and suggest a treatment plan.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Kidney Injury (pre-renal, likely secondary to dehydration and lisinopril)
2. Acute Pancreatitis
3. Rhabdomyolysis
4. Sepsis
5. Alcoholic Liver Disease exacerbation

Treatment:
1. Aggressive fluid resuscitation with IV normal saline to restore intravascular volume and improve renal perfusion.
2. Electrolyte management: Correct hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and any other electrolyte imbalances.  Closely monitor potassium levels, especially during fluid resuscitation.
3. Discontinue lisinopril.
4. Pain management for potential pancreatitis: IV opioids as needed.
5. NPO status initially, then advance diet as tolerated.
6. Monitor for signs of infection and consider broad-spectrum antibiotics if sepsis is suspected.
7. Insulin therapy to manage hyperglycemia.
8. Thiamine supplementation to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy given his history of alcoholism.
9. Close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes, and vital signs.
10. Further investigation for the cause of pancreatitis (e.g., gallstones, alcohol) once the patient is stabilized.
11. Consult nephrology for AKI management and gastroenterology for pancreatitis management.
