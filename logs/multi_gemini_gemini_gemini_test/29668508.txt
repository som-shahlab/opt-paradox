HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___. female awoke this morning with severe crampy  infraumbilical pain, evolved into bandlike suprapubic  distribution.  Denies fever, chills.  C/o nausea with  non-bloody, bilious emesis x 3.  Reports diarrhea.  Denies sick  contacts with GI symptoms.    Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: Denies family history of gastrointestinal disorders, grandfather  with lung cancer and h/o smoking, denies other cancer


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The pain started periumbilical and migrated to the suprapubic area, which, along with the other symptoms, suggests a gastrointestinal issue.  Several diagnoses are possible, including gastroenteritis, appendicitis (although less likely given the pain migration), bowel obstruction, or inflammatory bowel disease. A physical exam is necessary to assess the abdomen for tenderness, guarding, rebound, and other signs.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation), vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate)

ToolMessage:
"Physical Exam upon admission: T: 98.2  P: 113  BP: 138/86  RR: 18  O2sat: 100% on RA General: awake, alert, NAD HEENT: NCAT, EOMI, anicteric Heart: RRR Lungs: normal excursion, no respiratory distress Back: no vertebral tenderness, no CVAT Abdomen: soft, ND, focal severe RLQ tenderness with involuntary  guarding, no rebound, negative Rovsing's sign Extremities: WWP, no CCE, no tenderness, 2+ B radial pulses Psychiatric: normal judgment/insight, normal memory, normal  mood/affect  Physical Exam"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The pain started periumbilical and migrated to the suprapubic area, which initially suggested a gastrointestinal issue such as gastroenteritis, appendicitis, bowel obstruction, or inflammatory bowel disease. However, the physical exam reveals focal severe RLQ tenderness with involuntary guarding, which is highly concerning for appendicitis. While Rovsing's sign is negative, it's not always reliable.  Given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, I suspect appendicitis.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast is not available in the list of imaging studies. The only available imaging study is a pelvic ultrasound (non-obstetric)."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The pain started periumbilical and migrated to the suprapubic area.  The physical exam reveals focal severe RLQ tenderness with involuntary guarding, highly concerning for appendicitis. While a CT scan would be ideal, only a pelvic ultrasound is available.  Given the patient's symptoms, physical exam findings, and the limited imaging options, a pelvic ultrasound is the next best step to assess for appendicitis and other potential causes of RLQ pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Pelvic ultrasound (non-obstetric)

ToolMessage:
"PELVIS, NON-OBSTETRIC (Ultrasound)  TECHNIQUE: Transabdominal examination was performed only as patient is not sexually active.  FINDINGS: The uterus measures 3.3 x 5.0 x 2.9 cm. The endometrium is homogeneously thin, measuring 3 mm. The ovaries are well visualized and are normal in morphology on gray-scale images. There are normal arterial and venous Doppler waveforms within both ovaries. A linear transducer was utilized to evaluate for ____ in the right lower quadrant. The appendix is visualized and is dilated up to 7 mm. The wall is hyperemic and the appendix could not be fully compressed on real-time imaging. No appendicolith is identified. There is minimal free fluid surrounding the appendix."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to suprapubic, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.  Physical exam revealed focal severe RLQ tenderness with involuntary guarding. While Rovsing's sign was negative, the other findings raised strong suspicion for appendicitis.  A pelvic ultrasound was performed since a CT scan was unavailable. The ultrasound confirmed the diagnosis, showing a dilated appendix (7mm) with hyperemic wall that could not be fully compressed, along with minimal surrounding free fluid. These findings are consistent with acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to suprapubic, along with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, initially raised suspicion for several gastrointestinal conditions. The physical exam revealed focal severe RLQ tenderness with involuntary guarding, pointing towards appendicitis. The pelvic ultrasound confirms the diagnosis, showing a dilated appendix (7mm) with hyperemic walls that couldn't be fully compressed, along with minimal surrounding free fluid. These findings are highly suggestive of acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Cyst (ruled out by normal ultrasound findings)
3. Mesenteric Adenitis (less likely given ultrasound findings)
4. Gastroenteritis (less likely given localized RLQ tenderness and ultrasound findings)
5. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (less likely given acute presentation and ultrasound findings)

Treatment:  The patient should be immediately started on IV fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin, or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole).  Surgical consultation should be obtained for laparoscopic appendectomy.  Pain management should be provided with opioid analgesics as needed.  The patient should be kept NPO and monitored for any signs of complications such as perforation or abscess formation.
