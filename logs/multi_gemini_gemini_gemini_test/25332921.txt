Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   - CAD   ___ NSTEMI; Stents placed in OM/LAD.   ___ Repeat cath for chest pain showing patent LAD stent but  occluded OM1 stent.   ___ cath showing 100% instent stenosis of OM1 stent treated  with cutting balloon and Hepacoat stent.   ___nd + ETT; cath showing twin LAD system with  90% stenosis in diagonal treated with Cypher stent.   ___ had another cath for presentation with CP showing patent  LAD stent but proximal LCX occlusion with bridging collaterals  and R to L collateral. Also had mild diffuse disease RCA c 60%  stenosis of RPL.   ___: LAD and diagonal stent patent, distal LCX system filling  via L > L and R > L collaterals and occlusion of obtuse marginal  stents with collaterals from RCA, underwent attempted ballooning  of occlusion but unsuccessful. Also had RCA disease (40%  proximal, 50% RPL).   ___: restenting of OM1   ___: DES to rPDA   - Hypertension   - Hyperlipidemia   - Up to 2 past episodes of atrial fibrillation, once in the  setting of an MI   - s/p pacemaker   .   PSH:   Cholecystectomy   Appendectomy   Partial hysterectomy   .     Social History: ___ Family History: Noncontributory.   .


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of CAD, recent stenting, and current chest pain unrelieved by NTG but relieved by morphine, there is concern for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, the patient also just had an ERCP, which can cause complications such as perforation or pancreatitis, both of which can present with chest pain.  I need to gather more information to differentiate between cardiac and non-cardiac causes of chest pain.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The significantly elevated lipase and amylase are highly suggestive of pancreatitis, likely post-ERCP pancreatitis.  The elevated AST, ALT, and total bilirubin are consistent with this diagnosis and her recent history of elevated liver enzymes. While ACS is still a possibility, the lack of EKG changes and negative troponin T (though troponin I would be more specific) make it less likely. The patient's chest pain resolving with morphine also supports a non-cardiac etiology, as morphine can relieve pain from various causes. The CT chest ordered to evaluate esophageal integrity is a reasonable precaution given the ERCP. I have enough information to make a presumptive diagnosis.
