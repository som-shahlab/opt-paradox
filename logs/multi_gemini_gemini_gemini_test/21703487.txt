HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ s/p lap chole on ___ at ___ presents with abdominal pain unremitting since 10AM this morning. She has not felt back to normal since her surgery. Has had intermittent RUQ/epigastric pain associated with nausea and vomiting. She notes low grade temp and chills at home with a Tmax at home of 99.5 per her report. However, the pain became unremitting today starting at 10AM, which prompted her to seek medical care. She  is unable to tolerate PO with the exception of a few Cheerios occasionally. She endorses loose stools (not frank diarrhea) and continues to pass flatus.   Of note, she was admitted to ___ service at ___ from ___ for similar symptoms. She had a negative HIDA scan at this time, and she was eventually discharged at this time with a PO challenge. There was concern for a retained stone per the notes from this hospitalization; however, per the patient, she had begged to go home and she was instructed to return if her symptoms continued or worsened.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's recent cholecystectomy and persistent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and low-grade fever, it's crucial to rule out common post-operative complications such as infection (e.g., surgical site infection, intra-abdominal abscess), retained common bile duct stone, or bile leak.  Additionally, her history of GERD could be contributing to her symptoms. I need more information to narrow down the possibilities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show elevated lipase, AST, and ALT, which, combined with her symptoms, strongly suggest pancreatitis.  The significantly elevated lipase points towards a pancreatic source for her abdominal pain. While her amylase is normal, it's important to remember that amylase can normalize more quickly than lipase in pancreatitis.  Her prior hospitalization for similar symptoms raises concern for recurrent pancreatitis.  Given her history of gallstones and recent cholecystectomy, a retained common bile duct stone is a likely cause. The abnormal urinalysis with proteinuria, hematuria, and leukocyturia may indicate a urinary tract infection, which could be coincidental or related to her overall clinical picture.  I have enough information to make a recommendation.
