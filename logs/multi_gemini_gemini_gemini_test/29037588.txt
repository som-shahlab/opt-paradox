Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The elevated lipase suggests pancreatitis. The CT abdomen findings of duodenitis and focal inflammatory changes of the right colon are noted, but may not fully explain the patient's symptoms. Given the patient's history of CAD s/p DES, HTN, and HLD, and current Plavix use, it's important to consider other potential causes of abdominal pain, including ischemic bowel. The patient's recent increase in fatty food and alcohol intake could have exacerbated pancreatitis.  I need to gather more information to determine the cause of the patient's persistent abdominal pain and rule out other serious conditions.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's persistent abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, elevated lipase, WBC, and mildly elevated AST/ALT suggest pancreatitis. The CT findings of duodenitis and focal inflammatory changes of the right colon may be related or incidental. The patient's history of CAD, HTN, HLD, and Plavix use raise concern for ischemic bowel, although the lactate is normal and the blood gas doesn't show significant acidosis. The slightly low pO2 may be due to pain or other factors.  The elevated BUN may be due to dehydration.  I have enough information to make a reasonable presumptive diagnosis.
