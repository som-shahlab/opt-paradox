HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms ___ is a ___ year old woman who presents as a tranfer from an OSH with complaints of 3 days of RUQ pain and nausea without vomiting and an ultrasound showing gallstones. She states that she was awoken from sleep at 2AM 3 days ago with severe epigastric and RUQ pain that was worse with movement. The pain was intermittent was but did not get better.  She had low grade fevers 100.0, no diarrhea, last BM yesterday, no blood.  Never had symptoms like this before, although she was aware she had gallstones.  Never had symptoms of biliary cholic.     Past Medical History: s/p appendectomy,  TAH,  total thyroidectomy (thyroid CA)   Social History: ___ Family History: positive for gallstones


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is presenting with RUQ pain, nausea, and fever, with a history of gallstones. This suggests a possible biliary pathology, such as acute cholecystitis.  However, given the epigastric pain and lack of prior biliary colic, other diagnoses like pancreatitis or peptic ulcer disease should also be considered. I need lab tests to assess for inflammation, liver function, and pancreatic enzymes.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain, nausea, and fever.  Ultrasound confirms gallstones. Labs show leukocytosis, elevated lipase, and mildly elevated ALT/AST.  The elevated lipase suggests pancreatitis or other pancreatic injury. While the patient has gallstones and symptoms suggestive of cholecystitis, the degree of lipase elevation is concerning for a concomitant process. I will request imaging to evaluate the pancreas and biliary tree.
Action: imaging
Action Input: MRCP

ToolMessage:
"Here is the MRCP report:  MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC):  TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images were acquired on 1.5 Tesla magnet including dynamic 3D imaging obtained prior to, during and after the uneventful intravenous administration of gadolinium-DTPA. Multiplanar 2D and 3D reformations and subtraction images were generated on an independent workstation.  FINDINGS: The liver is of normal size and normal signal intensity on all images. Gallbladder is seen full of stones with a thickened wall without evidence of significant pericholecystic hepatic enhancement. No evidence of intrahepatic bile duct dilatation is seen. CBD is not dilated. There is an anatomic variant with an aberrant right posterior duct draining into the common hepatic duct. Pancreas is of normal size and intensity without evidence of peripancreatic edema. There is mucosal enhancement and there is small amount of periduodenal edema around the second and third portion of the duodenum, findings which may be due to ____ or due to the primary process in the duodenum. The appearance of the adrenals, spleen, kidneys is unremarkable. There is no evidence of retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. No evidence of free fluid in the abdomen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: This patient presented with RUQ pain, nausea, and fever. Ultrasound showed gallstones, and labs revealed leukocytosis, elevated lipase, and mildly elevated ALT/AST. The elevated lipase raised concern for pancreatitis or other pancreatic injury. The MRCP showed a normal pancreas without peripancreatic edema or ductal dilation, but did reveal gallstones and a thickened gallbladder wall, consistent with cholecystitis. The periduodenal edema noted on the MRCP is likely reactive and secondary to the cholecystitis.  The elevated lipase may be a result of the cholecystitis and/or the aberrant right posterior bile duct. Given the constellation of findings, the diagnosis is acute cholecystitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Gallstone pancreatitis
2. Acute cholecystitis
3. Biliary colic
4. Peptic ulcer disease
5. Diverticulitis

Treatment: Admit the patient for supportive management of gallstone pancreatitis. This includes NPO status, IV fluids, pain control, and antiemetics. Monitor lipase and amylase trends.  Once the pancreatitis resolves, cholecystectomy should be performed, preferably laparoscopically, to prevent recurrence of gallstone pancreatitis.  Consult surgery for cholecystectomy.
