HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ presenting with 3 days of RLQ abdominal pain. Patient was having severe nausea/vomiting x 9 times initially. She was seen at ___ 3 days ago. Patient was tender in the RLQ, WBC was 15.___bd/pelvis was reported as normal appendix, some free fluid in the pelvis and an adnexal cyst. She was discharged home and followed up with her GYN. Patient had persistent abdominal pain localized in the RLQ, no nausea or vomiting, no fevers/chills. Pt went to OBGYN which did a pelvic exam which was normal and negative pregnancy test. Pelvic US was also negative.    Past Medical History:  PE ___ s/p anticoagulation for 6 months    Family History: Noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ abdominal pain for 3 days.  Initial presentation included severe nausea and vomiting, elevated WBC, and free fluid in the pelvis. While the appendix appeared normal on imaging, and the patient's OBGYN evaluation was negative, the persistent RLQ pain warrants further investigation to rule out other potential causes. I need to understand the character of the pain, any associated symptoms, and evaluate for other abdominal pathologies.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on RLQ tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure

ToolMessage:
"Upon presentation to ___: Vitals: 98.0 74 115/79 16 100%  GEN: A&Ox3, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, severe tenderness to palpation in the RLQ, mild localized rebound and guarding. Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient continues to experience RLQ pain despite a normal pelvic exam and ultrasound. The initial presentation with nausea, vomiting, elevated WBC, and free fluid in the pelvis, along with the persistent localized tenderness, raises concern for appendicitis or another inflammatory process. Although the initial CT scan reported a normal appendix, it's possible for appendicitis to be missed on imaging, especially early in the course of the disease.  Given the persistent symptoms and concerning initial findings, repeating abdominal imaging is warranted.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast. Multiplanar reformations were obtained and reviewed.  FINDINGS: The partially imaged lungs show bibasilar atelectasis. The partially imaged heart is unremarkable.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, both adrenals, both kidneys, pancreas and gallbladder are unremarkable. No abdominal, retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria is present. The colon is unremarkable. The appendix shows a thickened wall with significant adjacent stranding, ending in a 1.1 x 2.0 cm fluid-filled tip. This is worsened compared to the previous examination. There is a small amount of nonhemorrhagic free fluid in the pelvis. Multiple dilated loops of small bowel show no transition point is likely related to ileus. Contrast fills the colon.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder and uterus are unremarkable. Bilateral ovarian cysts were better evaluated on concurrent pelvic ultrasound. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy is present.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The visible osseous structures show no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions or fractures."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The repeat CT scan demonstrates a thickened appendix with surrounding stranding and a fluid-filled tip, consistent with appendicitis. This finding, combined with the patient's persistent RLQ pain, initial elevated WBC, and free fluid in the pelvis, confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The repeat CT scan clearly demonstrates a thickened appendix with surrounding stranding and a fluid-filled tip, consistent with acute appendicitis. This explains the patient's persistent RLQ pain, initial nausea and vomiting, elevated WBC, and free pelvic fluid.  The initial CT scan may have missed the appendicitis due to its early stage. The current findings warrant surgical intervention.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (ruled out by negative pelvic exam and ultrasound)
3. Ovarian Cyst Rupture (less likely given persistent localized pain and CT findings)
4. Mesenteric Adenitis (less likely given CT findings)
5. Gastroenteritis (less likely given persistent localized pain and CT findings)

Treatment:  The patient requires emergent appendectomy. Consult surgery for laparoscopic or open appendectomy.  Administer IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte balance. Provide pain management with IV analgesics. Administer pre-operative antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole). Post-operative care should include wound care, pain management, and monitoring for complications such as infection or abscess formation.
