HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with 18h RLQ pain presenting to PCP where exam findings concerning for this afternoon referred to ___ ED. Endorses intermittent nausea, subjective fever. Denies chills, emesis, abdominal distention, change in bowel habits. Maintains bowel function with passage of gas and stool. Denies PO intolerance. Last colonoscopy ___ at OSH, reportedly normal.   Past Medical History: PMH: Hypothyroid, HL  PSH: multiple orthopedic procedures: R foot x2, L shoulder, L hand    Social History: ___ Family History: non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and subjective fever, which are concerning for appendicitis.  Given the patient's history and the possibility of appendicitis, I need to gather more information through physical examination and laboratory tests to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.
Action: physical examination

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and subjective fever. Physical exam reveals tenderness, guarding in the RLQ, but no rebound tenderness.  While the patient's presentation is suggestive of appendicitis, other diagnoses such as ovarian torsion or a kidney stone need to be considered. Laboratory tests and imaging are necessary to further evaluate the patient's condition and determine the appropriate course of treatment.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, and subjective fever, along with physical exam findings of RLQ tenderness and guarding, raises suspicion for appendicitis.  The elevated white blood cell count further supports this possibility.  However, a urinalysis is needed to rule out a urinary tract infection or kidney stone, and a pregnancy test should be performed to exclude ectopic pregnancy in female patients.  An abdominal CT scan is also necessary to visualize the appendix and confirm the diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including RLQ pain, nausea, subjective fever, and elevated WBCs, points towards appendicitis.  The physical exam findings of RLQ tenderness and guarding further support this. Although I've requested a urinalysis and pregnancy test, the results are not yet available.  To avoid delays in diagnosis and treatment, I will order an abdominal CT scan now, which can help visualize the appendix and confirm the diagnosis.  I will review the urinalysis and pregnancy test results when they become available to definitively rule out other conditions.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal CT scan

ToolMessage:
"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAM: Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis.  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast. Reformatted coronal and sagittal images were also obtained.  FINDINGS: LUNG BASES: Very minimal bilateral dependent atelectasis is seen. No focal consolidation or pleural effusion is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: The liver is diffusely low in attenuation, consistent with fatty infiltration. No focal intrahepatic lesion is seen. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. The kidneys uptake and excrete contrast symmetrically bilaterally. There is no hydronephrosis bilaterally. No upper abdominal free fluid or free air is seen. There is no upper abdominal lymphadenopathy.  PELVIS: The appendix in the right lower quadrant is dilated, measuring up to 1.4 cm, containing fluid, thickened, hyperemic wall. There is surrounding periappendiceal stranding and small amount of fluid in the right lower quadrant. No extraluminal gas or drainable fluid collection is seen. The bladder is unremarkable and thin-walled. The prostate is enlarged. The prostate gland may contain a few calcifications. No pelvic lymphadenopathy is seen.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Mild degenerative changes are seen at the left greater than right bilateral anterior sacroiliac joints. There is mild intervertebral disc space narrowing at L5-S1 and minimal osteophytosis seen throughout the lumbar spine. No concerning osteoblastic or lytic lesion is seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with RLQ pain, nausea, and subjective fever. Physical exam revealed RLQ tenderness and guarding.  Lab results showed an elevated WBC count.  The abdominal CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with a thickened, hyperemic wall, periappendiceal stranding, and fluid in the right lower quadrant.  Although urinalysis and pregnancy test results are still pending, the CT findings are sufficient to diagnose appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian torsion (less likely given CT findings)
3. Kidney stone (less likely given CT findings)
4. Urinary tract infection (less likely given CT findings)
5. Ectopic pregnancy (less likely given CT findings)

Treatment:  The patient should be given intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antibiotics.  A surgical consult should be obtained for an appendectomy.  Laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred surgical approach.  The patient should be monitored for complications such as perforation, abscess formation, and peritonitis.
