Last meal  yesterday soup at 2pm which worsened pain.  No f/c, cp/sob,  denies diarrhea, constpiation, dysuria, medication changes,  herbals supplements, recent travel. .   In the ED, initial vitals were 98.2  63  ___  700RA,  Amylase and lipase came back markedly elevated. A RUQ U/S was  negative for gallstones. She received dilaudid 0.5mg IV x2.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with back pain radiating to the epigastrum, with markedly elevated amylase and lipase. This suggests a potential pancreatic issue, such as pancreatitis. A RUQ ultrasound was negative for gallstones, ruling out gallstone-induced pancreatitis.  I need more information to determine the etiology of the pancreatitis and assess the patient's overall condition.  Specifically, I need to know the patient's age, pain level, respiratory rate, and the time frame of the lithotripsy procedure. I also need to understand her social history better, including alcohol use, smoking status, and any potential toxic exposures.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Complete abdominal exam, including palpation for tenderness and guarding; Auscultation for bowel sounds;  Vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is experiencing epigastric tenderness with decreased bowel sounds, along with the previously noted elevated amylase and lipase. This further supports the possibility of pancreatitis. The absence of CVA tenderness argues against pyelonephritis as a cause of the back pain.  The patient's vital signs show tachycardia, which could be due to pain or other underlying issues.  The absence of jaundice and normal sclera lessen the concern for biliary obstruction.  To determine the etiology of the pancreatitis and assess its severity, I need to know the patient's alcohol use, smoking history, and medication list.  I also need laboratory tests to evaluate her organ function and look for potential complications.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results are largely normal, including liver function tests and lipid panel.  This makes hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis less likely.  The normal calcium and magnesium levels are important to note as these can be altered in pancreatitis.  The absence of CRP, lactate, blood alcohol level, and urine toxicology screen makes it difficult to fully assess the cause of pancreatitis and potential complications. I still need this information, as well as the patient's social history including alcohol and smoking, and a complete medication list to determine the most likely etiology.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with back pain radiating to the epigastrum and markedly elevated amylase and lipase, highly suggestive of pancreatitis.  Despite repeated requests, CRP, lactate, blood alcohol level, and urine toxicology screen are unavailable. The RUQ ultrasound was negative for gallstones, and other laboratory results are normal.  While lacking some desired information, the clinical picture strongly points towards pancreatitis.  I will proceed with a diagnosis of pancreatitis of unknown etiology and recommend further investigation and management accordingly.
