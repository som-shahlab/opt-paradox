HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old year old male with no significant PMHx, p/w RLQ pain  starting ___ after lunch, associated w/ mild nausea, no  emesis. Patient reports anorexia but otherwise denies  fevers/chills. Patient denies migration or radiation of pain  anywhere. Upon evaluation in ED, patient appeared comfortable.  Abdomen significant for focal RLQ TTP, no rebound/guarding.      Past Medical History: Anxiety   Social History: ___ Family History: Father with hematologic malignancy


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, nausea, and anorexia, concerning for appendicitis.  Given the focal tenderness and lack of rebound/guarding, I need to gather more information to assess the severity and rule out other diagnoses like mesenteric adenitis, gastroenteritis, or a kidney stone.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign, rectal exam, temperature

ToolMessage:
"Physical Exam on admission ___: Vitals - T 98.3 / HR 68 / BP 118/74 / RR 16 / O2sat 100% RA  General - comfortable, NAD HEENT - moist mucous membranes, PERRLA, EOMI Cardiac - RRR, no M/R/G Chest - CTAB Abdomen - soft, nondistended, focal TTP in RLQ, no  rebound/guarding Extremities - warm and well-perfused Neuro - A&OX3  Physical Exam"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation is consistent with appendicitis.  The physical exam findings of focal RLQ tenderness, along with nausea and anorexia, increase the suspicion for appendicitis.  While the lack of rebound tenderness and guarding argues against a perforated appendix, I would like imaging to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 4.5 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 21.7 mGy (Body) DLP = 10.8 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 5.3 s, 57.9 cm; CTDIvol = 16.4 mGy (Body) DLP = 949.5 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 960 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. Portal venous system is patent.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Colon and rectum are within normal limits. The base of the appendix is mildly enlarged, measuring up to 8 mm, with thickened walls. Together with mucosal hyperemia and periappendiceal fat stranding, findings are compatible with early acute ____. No abscess or perforation.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate and seminal vesicles are normal.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. A few prominent mesenteric lymph nodes measuring up to 9 mm in the right lower quadrant are likely reactive. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, anorexia, and focal RLQ tenderness, combined with the CT findings of an enlarged appendix with thickened walls, mucosal hyperemia, and periappendiceal fat stranding, confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, anorexia, focal RLQ tenderness, and the CT findings of an enlarged appendix with thickened walls, mucosal hyperemia, and periappendiceal fat stranding confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  There is no evidence of perforation or abscess.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Gastroenteritis
4. Kidney Stone
5. Constipation

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment for acute appendicitis.  Given the early presentation, a laparoscopic appendectomy is preferred.  The patient should be given IV fluids, analgesics, and antibiotics (covering gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria) preoperatively.  Post-operative care should include pain management, wound care, and monitoring for complications such as infection or ileus.  The patient should be discharged once they are tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, and pain is well-controlled.
