HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old woman with severe asthma, transferred from ___  ___ after five days of nausea and abdominal pain. Patient  reports developing diffuse myalgias starting 6 days PTA, which  were accompanied by "dry heaves". Patient was only able to  tolerate "crackers and water" due to pain, which developed over  the right upper quadrant. Patient began vomiting 4 days PTA,  which she describes as gastric contents, non bilious or bloody.  Denies diarrhea or change in color of stool. Denies any sick  contacts, but does report low grade fevers at home up to 101.  Patient reports she called her PCP who believed this could be  "flu". Pain continued to worsen so Ms ___ decided to go to  the closest hospital.  ROS: Patient denies any chest pain, palpitations, shortness of  breath, dizziness or syncope. She does report heat/cold  intolerance and frequent "hot flashes". ~20lb weight loss over ___  years.  ___ course: Suspicion for cholangitis; CT scan obtained which revealed  percholecystic fluid and gallstones. Patient trasiently placed  on on pressors (lowest documented SBP in ___) and given unasyn,  ceftriaxone and flagyl. Transfered to ___ for further  management.  ED Course: Patient re-dosed with antibiotics, right upper  quadrant ultrasound and MRCP ordered. Admitted to medicine for  further evaluation.   Past Medical History: Medical History Asthma Diabetes (non insulin dependent) Hypothyroidism Gastroesophageal reflux  Surgical History T&A  s/p appendectomy  s/p ruptured ectopic pregnancy   Social History: ___ Family History: Mother died of old age, father died of "bone cancer". Oldest  sister with ___ dementia


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of severe asthma, nausea, abdominal pain, myalgias, fevers, and initial suspicion of cholangitis, more information is needed to understand the full clinical picture and potential complications. The patient's report of heat/cold intolerance and weight loss also warrants further investigation.  It's important to rule out other potential causes of her symptoms and assess the severity of her current condition.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute cholecystitis, supported by the initial CT findings and elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin. The elevated white blood cell count with left shift (increased neutrophils and bands) further suggests an infectious process.  The presence of ketones in the urine, along with nausea, vomiting, and poor oral intake, may indicate dehydration and potential diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), especially given her history of diabetes.  The low albumin and calcium levels could be related to malnutrition or other underlying conditions.  While the lipase and amylase are within normal limits, they don't entirely rule out pancreatitis, which can sometimes present with predominantly hepatic dysfunction.  The patient's history of asthma, recent weight loss, and heat/cold intolerance also warrant consideration for other systemic illnesses.  To finalize the diagnosis and management plan, additional lab tests are needed.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation points towards acute cholecystitis with possible underlying DKA given the history of diabetes, nausea, vomiting, poor oral intake, and urine ketones. The elevated liver function tests and bilirubin support the diagnosis of cholecystitis, while the leukocytosis with left shift suggests an infectious component. The low albumin and calcium may indicate malnutrition or other underlying metabolic derangements. Although lipase and amylase are normal, pancreatitis cannot be entirely ruled out.  The patient's history of asthma, weight loss, and heat/cold intolerance should also be considered in the differential diagnosis.  Given the available information, I can provide a reasonable differential diagnosis and suggest a management plan.
