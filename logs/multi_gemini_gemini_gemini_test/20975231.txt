Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/cholelithasis, s/p CCY presents from ___ with epigastric  pain. Pt was awoken from sleep this yesterday am at 0400 with  sharp, pleuritic, epigastric/RUQ pain, NBNB vomiting. Pt reports  this pain is different from prior gallstone pain. Also with  diarrhea today. At ___ ED pt was hypotensive to 89/43 on  arrival. Improved to 119/58 prior to transfer with fluids. CT  A/P read as concern for biliary stone and pancreatic  inflammation, lipase 18,981 Tbili 1.6, AST 222, ALT 158, lactate  3.4. Received zosyn, fentanyl, morphine, zofran and protonix,  2Lns. transferred for ERCP.

Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric pain, hypotension, and significantly elevated lipase, concerning for acute pancreatitis. The CT scan suggests biliary stones and pancreatic inflammation, supporting the diagnosis. Given the patient's history of cholelithiasis and the current presentation, gallstone pancreatitis is likely. However, I need to gather more information to assess the severity of pancreatitis and rule out other potential causes.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show elevated glucose, likely due to the stress of acute pancreatitis.  The patient also has a low platelet count, high neutrophils, low lymphocytes, elevated AST/ALT, low magnesium, and high potassium. These findings are consistent with acute pancreatitis. The patient's history, presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results all point towards gallstone pancreatitis as the diagnosis.  I have enough information to make a recommendation.
