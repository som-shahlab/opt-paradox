HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ p/w acute onset diffuse abdominal pain since 4pm yesterday.  Pain was constant and increasing in intensity, localizing to RLQ  earlier this AM. Now also radiating to LLQ. This morning she  reported n/v/d. LMP 1 week ago. Able to eat last night. Feels  hungry and thirsty. Denies fever, chills, sob, dysuria.    Past Medical History: PMH: None PSH: bilateral breast augmentation    Social History: ___ Family History: uncle is  surgeon    Admission


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating from diffuse to localized in the RLQ and now radiating to LLQ, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This raises suspicion for appendicitis, but other differentials like ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, or diverticulitis should also be considered given the patient's age and sex.  A physical exam is necessary to evaluate for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on RLQ tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign,  pelvic exam

ToolMessage:
"Vitals 99.0 59 132/78 16 100% RA  Gen: anxious, mild distress Lungs: clear. Unlabored Cardio: RRR Abd: soft, tender at ___, + Rovsing, +obturator, +psoas signs. Non-peritoneal Ext: wnl"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, initially diffuse but now localized to the RLQ with radiation to the LLQ, along with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The positive Rovsing's, obturator, and psoas signs on physical exam strongly suggest appendicitis.  While other differentials like ovarian torsion or pelvic inflammatory disease are possible, the clinical picture points towards appendicitis as the most likely diagnosis.  A CT scan would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: ___ MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of IV contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images in coronal and sagittal axes were generated and reviewed.  FINDINGS: The bases of the lungs demonstrate mild atelectasis. Note is made of bilateral breast implants. The liver is normal without evidence of focal hepatic lesions or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The portal vein is patent. The adrenal glands bilaterally are normal. The spleen is homogenous and normal in size. The kidneys bilaterally are normal without evidence of focal solid or cystic lesions concerning for malignancy. There is symmetric excretion of contrast. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. The pancreas is normal without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. The stomach, duodenum and small bowel are normal without wall obstruction or thickening. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no evidence of any intraabdominal free air. The colon is normal. There is evidence of ____ in the right lower quadrant with the appendix measuring up to 1.2 cm with surrounding fat stranding, fluid, and edema. There is a 0.6-cm appendicolith at the base of the appendix (2;56). The contours of the appendix are intact, without evidence of perforation.  CT PELVIS: The urinary bladder is normal. There is minimal complex pelvic free fluid. The uterus and adnexa appear to be unremarkable. There is no inguinal or pelvic wall lymphadenopathy.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No lytic or blastic lesions concerning for malignancy are identified."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with acute abdominal pain migrating from diffuse to RLQ and radiating to LLQ, with associated n/v/d. Physical exam revealed positive Rovsing's, obturator, and psoas signs.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, demonstrating a dilated appendix measuring 1.2 cm with an appendicolith and surrounding fat stranding, fluid, and edema.  There is no evidence of perforation. The other abdominal and pelvic organs appear normal.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute RLQ pain with migration from diffuse abdominal pain, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and positive Rovsing's, obturator, and psoas signs strongly suggested appendicitis. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, revealing a dilated appendix measuring 1.2 cm with surrounding fat stranding, fluid, and edema, along with an appendicolith. The absence of perforation is noted.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Cyst
3. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
4. Diverticulitis
5. Mesenteric Adenitis

Treatment:  Appendectomy is indicated given the confirmed diagnosis of acute appendicitis. This can be performed laparoscopically or via an open approach, with laparoscopic appendectomy being preferred in most cases due to its less invasive nature and faster recovery time.  The patient should be given intravenous fluids for hydration and electrolyte management, along with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover common enteric bacteria and prevent post-operative infection.  Pain management should be provided with appropriate analgesics.  Post-operative care should include monitoring for complications such as infection, bleeding, or abscess formation.  The patient should be advised to follow a light diet initially and gradually return to a normal diet as tolerated.
