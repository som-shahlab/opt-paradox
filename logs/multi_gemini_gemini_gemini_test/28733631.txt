HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year woman presents to ED with acute onset severe epigastric  pain radiating to both LUQ and RUQ associated with nasuea and  vomiting.  She says she felt feverish as well but did not taker  her temperature.  Pain was associated with chest pain as well,  and reflux symtpoms.  Kept her awake all night last night.  She  has had pain like this before, but not as severe and not lasting  as long.  No dysuria. No shortness of breath.    Past Medical History: Hypothyroidism Hypercholesterolemia (Not treated)   Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute severe epigastric pain radiating to both upper quadrants, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, fever, chest pain, and reflux symptoms.  This presentation suggests several possible diagnoses, including acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis, peptic ulcer disease, myocardial infarction, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). To differentiate between these possibilities, I need more information about the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and a more detailed history.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation),  abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation focusing on tenderness, guarding, rigidity, and rebound tenderness), cardiovascular exam (heart sounds, murmurs, rubs, gallops), pulmonary exam (lung sounds)

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is an elderly woman presenting with acute severe epigastric pain radiating to both upper quadrants, along with nausea, vomiting, fever, chest pain, and reflux symptoms.  The physical exam reveals tenderness in the epigastrium and RUQ with a positive Murphy's sign, suggesting possible cholecystitis.  The elevated blood pressure could be due to pain or underlying hypertension.  The absence of rebound tenderness and guarding argues against peritonitis.  Given the constellation of symptoms and signs, cholecystitis is high on the differential, but other possibilities like pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, and myocardial infarction still need to be ruled out. I will order laboratory tests to further narrow the differential diagnosis.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: Complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), lipase, amylase, troponin, urinalysis

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results are largely normal, including lipase, amylase, and troponin. This makes pancreatitis and myocardial infarction less likely.  The normal liver function tests and bilirubin make choledocholithiasis less likely. Given the patient's presentation with acute severe epigastric and RUQ pain, positive Murphy's sign, and the absence of other laboratory abnormalities, the most likely diagnosis is acute cholecystitis. An abdominal ultrasound is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal ultrasound
