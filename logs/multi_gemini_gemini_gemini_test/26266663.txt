HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old female who was in her usual  state of health until the morning of admission when she  developed acute onset, non-radiating epigastric pain.  This was soon after eating and lasted  approximately twenty minutes. The pain resolved after she took  aspirin and tums, but she's unsure if that was responsible for  alleviating her pain.  Of note, she had a similar episode  several months ago, which resolved without intervention. On  further questioning, she states that over the past several years she has  also had intermittent bouts of RUQ pain. It typically starts  shortly after eating and frequently awakens her from sleep.  There is a direct associated with fatty meals. She denies  fevers, chills or substernal chest pain.    Past Medical History: PHM: denies medical problems  PSH: c-section    Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's recurrent epigastric and RUQ pain, especially associated with fatty meals, suggests biliary colic or other gallbladder pathology.  The similar previous episode and the intermittent RUQ pain waking her from sleep further support this. To confirm the diagnosis, I need to visualize the gallbladder and surrounding structures.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound):  TECHNIQUE: Real-time 2 dimensional grayscale ultrasound of the right upper quadrant was performed using a curved array transducer.  FINDINGS: There numerous small layering gallstones identified within the gallbladder. There is apparent gallbladder wall thickening however the gallbladder is not distended and this appearance may be in part due to incomplete distention. Of note, patient ate 3 hours prior to exam. There is no pericholecystic fluid nor sonographic ___ sign. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation, the common bile duct measures 3 mm. The liver is essentially unremarkable noting a subcentimeter cyst in the right lobe. There is normal directional flow in the main portal vein. The included portion of the right kidney is unremarkable without hydronephrosis. IVC and aorta are unremarkable. Spleen is normal in size."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms, combined with the ultrasound findings of gallstones and gallbladder wall thickening, strongly suggest chronic cholecystitis. The association of pain with fatty meals and the prior episodes further support this diagnosis.  The absence of pericholecystic fluid or sonographic Murphy's sign argues against acute cholecystitis at this time.  The normal common bile duct measurement makes choledocholithiasis less likely.  No further information is needed for diagnosis.
