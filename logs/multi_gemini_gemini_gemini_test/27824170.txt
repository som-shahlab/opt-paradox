Patient History:
___ yo male with no significant past medical history who  presented to the surgical service with epigastric pain on ___  transferred to medicine for continued mgmt of duodenitis and new  diagnosis of diabetes. . Per patient reports acute onset diffuse abdominal pain. Pain is  located in "pit of stomach" described as stabbing and sharp in  character. Denies associated n/v. Did report intermittent  constipation in days leading up to presentation however took  laxative and developed subsequent loose stools.  Progressive pain prompted presentation to OSH.

Thought: The patient presents with epigastric pain, initially attributed to duodenitis, but without improvement on antibiotics.  He also has new-onset diabetes with markedly elevated glucose levels.  The abdominal pain, location, and elevated glucose raise suspicion for pancreatitis. I need to gather more information to confirm or rule out this possibility, as well as other differential diagnoses like cholecystitis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lipase and amylase are normal, making pancreatitis less likely.  The elevated triglycerides are notable, however, and could be contributing to his duodenitis.  His initial CT scan showed duodenal inflammation and periduodenal fluid.  Given the persistent pain despite antibiotics, I would want to re-image the abdomen to assess for any changes or complications, such as an abscess. The new onset diabetes is also a key finding that requires further management.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT Abdomen with contrast report from the available studies:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the abdomen with the administration of oral and IV contrast. Multiplanar reformats were generated and reviewed.  FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The visualized lung bases are clear with no focal consolidation or pleural effusion. The visualized heart and pericardium are unremarkable.    The liver appears low in attenuation consistent with fatty infiltration with some areas of fat sparing adjacent to gallbladder fossa. The gallbladder, spleen and bilateral adrenal glands appear unremarkable. Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis or renal calculi. There is swelling of the pancreatic head with slight decrease in attenuation of the pancreatic head, suggesting edema and extensive stranding surrounding the pancreas, with inflammatory change and fluid tracking along the second and third parts of the duodenum, around the porta hepatis and down along the anterior pararenal space as well as posterior to the ascending colon. There is no evidence of free air. The common bile duct shows mild periductal enhancement at the level of the head of the pancreas. No calcified gallstone is noted. There is no intrahepatic bile duct dilation.    The abdominal aorta appears unremarkable. The portal vein, splenic vein, and SMV appear patent. An area of soft tissue identical to the prior examination in the portacaval space measures 20 x 9 mm and is unchanged in size compared to the most recent prior examination and most likely represents a portacaval lymph node. A calcified structure anterior to the esophagus (2:8) is unchanged from the prior examination may represent a calcified node. Intra-abdominal loops of large bowel appear grossly unremarkable.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Four consecutive thoracic vertebral bodies show presence of Schmorl's nodes. Slight anterior wedging of L1 and L2 are noted. Mild kyphosis is noted. Overall, findings may indicate prior Sc___'s disease.  Note: While this is a CT abdomen with contrast, it's not exactly the same as the requested CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast, as the pelvis portion is not included in this study."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The repeat CT abdomen shows persistent pancreatic head swelling, edema, and extensive stranding, along with inflammatory changes and fluid tracking along the duodenum.  This, combined with the patient's persistent epigastric pain despite antibiotics, points towards a diagnosis of pancreatitis, likely due to the elevated triglycerides. The absence of gallstones on the CT makes gallstone pancreatitis less likely. The patient's new-onset diabetes is likely stress-induced hyperglycemia related to the pancreatitis.  While the CT doesn't include the pelvis, the findings in the abdomen are sufficient to explain the patient's symptoms.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Pancreatitis (likely hypertriglyceridemic)
2. Duodenitis (secondary to pancreatitis)
3. New-onset Diabetes Mellitus (possibly secondary to pancreatitis)

5. Cholecystitis (less likely given normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, but cannot be entirely ruled out)

Treatment:
* **NPO:** Continue NPO status to allow the pancreas to rest.
* **IV Fluids:** Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids (e.g., Lactated Ringer's or Normal Saline) to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance.
* **Pain Management:** IV opioid analgesics (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone) for pain control. Consider a PCA pump for patient-controlled analgesia.

* **Monitoring:** Closely monitor vital signs, fluid balance, electrolytes, glucose levels, and lipase/amylase trends.  Repeat imaging (CT scan) may be necessary if there are signs of complications (e.g., abscess, pseudocyst).
* **Consultations:** Endocrinology consultation for diabetes management.  Registered dietitian consultation for nutritional counseling.
