InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of multiple cancers, including kidney and bladder cancer, and a new diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. He presents with worsening epigastric pain, diarrhea, gas, flatulence, weakness, unsteady gait, decreased appetite, dark urine, emesis, and weight loss.  He also has elevated lipase and WBC. Given his history and current symptoms, I need to assess for potential complications like pancreatitis, cholangitis, or bowel obstruction, as well as evaluate his overall condition. I also need to understand the status of his splenic vein thrombosis.

Thought: The patient's lab results show elevated white blood cells with neutrophilia, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process.  The elevated lipase and amylase are consistent with pancreatitis.  The elevated INR, PT, and PTT raise concern for a coagulopathy, possibly related to his lovenox use or an underlying liver issue, although his LFTs are currently normal.  His hyponatremia and hypochloremia need further investigation, but could be related to dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea.  I will order imaging to evaluate the pancreas and surrounding structures.
Action: imaging

LYMPH NODES: There is no adenopathy.  VASCULAR: Abdominal aorta is normal in caliber with patent intra-abdominal branches. There are no acute vascular occlusions are pseudoaneurysms. There is severe attenuation of the portal vein at its confluence with patent SMV, splenic vein and main portal vein.

BONES: There are multilevel degenerative changes of the lower thoracic upper lumbar spine with no acute osseous abnormalities or suspicious osseous lesions.  SOFT TISSUES: Soft tissues are unremarkable."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan reveals a 1.4 cm hypoenhancing lesion at the pancreatic neck consistent with his known poorly differentiated adenosquamous carcinoma.  There is peripancreatic fluid and free intraperitoneal air, concerning for a perforated viscus, likely related to the pancreatic lesion.  The CT also shows inflammatory changes along the stomach, an intramural collection along the lesser curvature of the stomach, and acute interstitial pancreatitis.  The severe attenuation of the portal vein at its confluence raises concern for portal vein thrombosis, although the SMV, splenic vein, and main portal vein are patent.  The patient's clinical picture of abdominal pain, elevated lipase and amylase, and CT findings are consistent with acute pancreatitis, likely complicated by perforation. The presence of free air necessitates urgent surgical consultation.
