HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ ___ Speaking and ___ Witness p/w RLQ pain and  nausea x24hrs. Pain progressively worse. She has never had this  type of pain before. She denies emesis, diarrhea, constipation.  No fevers or chills. Last colonoscopy was ___ which showed  adenomatous polyps.     Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Goiter s/p resection Nose bleed in ___ and ___ with packing   Past Surgical History: Tubal ligation Thyroid surgery    Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, nausea, and no bowel changes. This presentation could suggest appendicitis, but other diagnoses like ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy (though unlikely with tubal ligation), or even diverticulitis are possible.  I need more information to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including tenderness, rebound, guarding, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign), pelvic exam

ToolMessage:
"Physical Exam on admission: Vitals: 98.4 91 133/75 18 RA  GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, obese, RLQ tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding  Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical exam reveals RLQ tenderness without rebound or guarding. This makes appendicitis more likely, but other diagnoses are still possible.  A CT scan would help visualize the appendix and other abdominal structures to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast report. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS:     TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with intravenous but not oral contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformations were also performed.  FINDINGS: There are no pleural effusions. A 3 mm nodular focus at the right lung base suggests a nodular form of atelectasis that is unchanged since the remote prior examination (2:6). A 3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe is also unchanged (2:5). Patchy mosaic attenuation in the posterior lower lobes is not specific but could be seen with atelectasis and possibly coinciding air-trapping.  CT ABDOMEN: There is no biliary dilatation. The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen and adrenal glands appear within normal limits. The right kidney is low-lying, but appears within normal limits. The left kidney also appears normal. In the mesentery of the left upper quadrant (2:34) there is a persistent ill-defined soft tissue density emanating posteriorly from the ligament of Treitz and measuring about 25 x 14 mm in axial ___. This correlates with an opacity that was visible on a remote prior CT from ___ that has not really changed since that time. On a later CT from ___, it was probably still present but unchanged in retrospect, overlapping somewhat with adjacent small bowel on that examination. The stomach and small bowel appear within normal limits. The appendix is dilated up to 15 mm in diameter with a fluid-filled lumen and hyperenhancement with surrounding fat stranding and a few small probably reactive nodes in the right lower quadrant measuring up to 5 mm in shortest dimension. The base of the cecum is mildly thickened where it arises from the colon. Otherwise, the colon is unremarkable. There is no evidence for abscess or perforation.  CT PELVIS: The uterus and adnexal regions appear within normal limits. There are no enlarged lymph nodes or ascites. Patchy atherosclerotic changes are present. The major mesenteric arteries and veins appear patent.  BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic bone lesions. Moderate degenerative changes affect lower lumbar facet joints especially at L3-L4 through L5-S1. Sclerosis involving anterior sacroiliac joints, particularly on the left, and this may reflect prior erosive change, although little if at all changed since remote prior studies. There is mild spondylolisthesis of L4 and L5 probably due to facet arthropathy. Spinal stenosis is probably in part congenital along the lower levels. The degree of canal stenosis appears mild-to-moderate at L1-L2 but severe from L2-L3 through L4-L5 and mild-to-moderate at L5-S1. This appearance is probably only worsened slightly over the long interval."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with a fluid-filled lumen, hyperenhancement, surrounding fat stranding, and reactive lymph nodes. There is no evidence of abscess or perforation.  The other findings in the abdomen, lungs, and pelvis are noted but do not appear to be directly related to the patient's current symptoms.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan shows a dilated appendix with a fluid-filled lumen, hyperenhancement, surrounding fat stranding, and reactive lymph nodes. These findings are highly suggestive of appendicitis. The other findings in the abdomen and pelvis are unremarkable or represent pre-existing conditions.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian cyst
3. Diverticulitis
4. Ectopic pregnancy
5. Mesenteric adenitis

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment for appendicitis. This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the severity of the inflammation and surgeon preference.  The patient should be started on IV fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem, or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole).  Pain management should be provided with opioids or other analgesics as needed.  Post-operative care includes monitoring for complications such as infection, bleeding, or abscess formation.
