HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y.o. man w/RLQ pain radiating to groin. Began 1  day prior to admission and was moderate in severity, exacerbated  with walking.  Pt. reports no relieving factors, no other  associated symptoms. No fever/chills, no chest pain/shortness of  breath, no nausea/vomiting, no change in bowel/bladder habits.     Past Medical History: HTN, DM, obesity, nephrolithiasis, HL    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain radiating to the groin, worsened by walking. This presentation is suggestive of several possible diagnoses, including appendicitis, inguinal hernia, kidney stones, or musculoskeletal issues.  Given his history of nephrolithiasis, a recurrence is possible.  I need to gather more information to differentiate between these possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, and masses), assessment of the inguinal area for hernia, costovertebral angle tenderness

ToolMessage:
"Admission  ___ Vitals: 98.1 97 136/78 20 98% RA  Gen - nad HEENT - neck supple, trache midline, sclrea non-icteric CV - regular Resp - unlabored respirations Abd - s/nd/focal tenderness RLQ, + Rosvigs, negative psoas, negative obturator.  Ext - no c/c/e"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain radiating to the groin, along with focal tenderness in the RLQ, positive Rovsing's sign, and negative psoas and obturator signs, strongly suggests appendicitis.  The absence of fever doesn't rule out appendicitis, as it may present atypically.  While his history of nephrolithiasis raises the possibility of a recurrence, the lack of costovertebral angle (CVA) tenderness on exam argues against this.  Given the high suspicion for appendicitis, I would proceed with imaging to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT through the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast with multiplanar reformations. No oral contrast administered.  FINDINGS: There is mild bilateral lower lobe dependent atelectasis. Scattered coronary artery calcifications are seen.  CT ABDOMEN: The hepatic parenchyma enhances homogeneously. No focal liver lesions are identified. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The portal vein is patent. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable. The retrocecal appendix is dilated to 16 mm and demonstrates surrounding fat stranding, compatible with ____. There is mild wall thickening within the cecum along the base of the appendix. The remainder of the colon is within normal limits. There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen. Small pericecal lymph nodes do not meet CT size criteria. There is no pathologically enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. Scattered aortic and bilateral iliac artery calcifications are seen. There is also noncalcified atheromatous disease within the inferior aspect of the aorta as well as within the left common iliac artery.  Pelvis CT: The bladder is unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. No pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes are seen.  Bone window: No osseous lesions concerning for infection or malignancy. Multilevel degenerative changes are seen throughout the imaged spine."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, demonstrating a dilated appendix with surrounding fat stranding.  The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and imaging results are all consistent with this diagnosis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with surrounding fat stranding.  The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT results all point towards this diagnosis.  The other differentials are less likely given the imaging results.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Nephrolithiasis
3. Inguinal hernia
4. Musculoskeletal pain
5. Diverticulitis

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy.  This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the severity of the inflammation and surgeon preference.  Preoperatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem, or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole).  Postoperatively, the patient should receive pain control, continue antibiotics as indicated, and be monitored for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  The patient should be educated on wound care and follow-up appointments.
