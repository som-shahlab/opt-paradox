Given dx of viral infection and d/c 2 days ago. Reports  that abd pain has continued to worsen and has become diffuse. Describes pain as burning made worse by brisk movement (i.e. driving in car, walking). Has also experienced nausea w/o vomiting and been unable to eat since ___. Last bowel  movement was on ___. She has not taken all anti-HTN meds since ___.    She was being observed in the ED overnight but continues to have persistent pain and no BMs despite multi-agent bowel meds with fleet enema. Not able to tolerate food but taking in PO fluids.   Past Medical History: CHF (dilated CM EF 33%)    HTN    DM    GERD    Asthma    Gout    Fibroids    chronic eczema on prednisone     Social History: ___ Family History: Mother with IDDM. Numerous maternal aunts/uncles with heart   disease, CHF. Father's history is unknown. Has one brother who   has HTN and Asthma.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with worsening abdominal pain, initially localized to the epigastric region and now diffuse, accompanied by cramping, diarrhea, and vomiting. This presentation, along with the history of CHF, HTN, DM, and GERD, raises concerns for several potential diagnoses, including bowel obstruction, ischemic bowel, peritonitis, or even a cardiac event. The patient's inability to tolerate food, lack of bowel movements despite bowel medications and enema, and worsening pain despite initial treatment warrant further investigation.  I need to gather more information about the patient's current condition and vital signs before proceeding.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation), abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation; assessing for tenderness, guarding, rebound, distension), cardiovascular exam (heart sounds, murmurs, rubs, gallops), pulmonary exam (lung sounds)

ToolMessage:
"ADMISSION  VITALS: T98, 108/76, 97, 18, 97% RA GENERAL: Alert and interactive. In moderate distress ___ abd. pain HEENT: NCAT. PERRL, EOMI. Sclera anicteric and without  injection. MMM. NECK: No cervical lymphadenopathy. No JVD. CARDIAC: Regular rhythm, normal rate. Audible S1 and S2. No murmurs/rubs/gallops. LUNGS: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. No wheezes, rhonchi or rales. No increased work of breathing. ABDOMEN: Minimal bowels sounds, soft, non distended, tender to deep palpation in all four quadrants and guarding EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema. Pulses DP/Radial  2+ bilaterally. SKIN: Warm. Cap refill <2s. No rash. NEUROLOGIC: CN2-12 intact. ___ strength throughout. Normal sensation. Gait is normal. AOx3."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with worsening diffuse abdominal pain, minimal bowel sounds, tenderness to deep palpation with guarding, and lack of bowel movements despite bowel medications and enema raises strong suspicion for a surgical abdomen, such as bowel obstruction or ischemic bowel.  Her history of CHF also raises the possibility of an acute cardiac event, although the normal cardiac exam and lack of respiratory distress make this less likely.  The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, but the tachycardia could indicate pain or dehydration. Given the patient's persistent symptoms and lack of response to conservative management, I need to evaluate for potential surgical causes.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show leukocytosis with neutrophilia, suggesting an inflammatory or infectious process. The low red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit indicate anemia, which could be chronic or related to acute blood loss.  The normal CMP, lipase, and lactic acid values help rule out some potential causes of abdominal pain, such as pancreatitis or mesenteric ischemia. The urinalysis findings of proteinuria, ketonuria, and bacteriuria suggest a possible urinary tract infection, which could contribute to the patient's overall clinical picture.  However, the patient's persistent abdominal pain, minimal bowel sounds, and guarding, along with the leukocytosis, point towards a potential surgical abdomen.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is necessary to further evaluate for bowel obstruction, ischemic bowel, or other intra-abdominal pathology.  I will also request a troponin and blood cultures to fully evaluate for cardiac involvement and potential sepsis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 7.5 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 54.2 mGy (Body) DLP = 27.1 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 5.5 s, 43.1 cm; CTDIvol = 19.7 mGy (Body) DLP = 850.1 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 877 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. There is extensive colonic diverticulosis. Mural thickening with pericolonic stranding and inflamed diverticula noted within proximal transverse colon at the hepatic flexure (02:37, 601:23) is consistent with a ____. There is no free air or organized fluid collection. No bowel obstruction. The appendix is normal.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus is surgically absent. Within the left adnexa is a complex 3.8 x 2.0 x 3.6 cm cystic structure with a hematocrit level and at least one septation which is new / increased in size since the ___ MR pelvis. This may represent a left hematosalpinx verses a ovarian hemorrhagic cyst.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the presence of diverticulitis in the proximal transverse colon, which explains the patient's abdominal pain, tenderness, and leukocytosis. The absence of free air or fluid collections suggests that the diverticulitis is not complicated by perforation or abscess. The incidental finding of a complex cystic structure in the left adnexa requires further evaluation, but it is unlikely to be the primary cause of the patient's current symptoms.  Given the patient's clinical presentation and CT findings, the diagnosis of diverticulitis is highly likely.  While waiting for troponin and blood culture results, I can confidently provide my final assessment.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Diverticulitis
2. Bowel Obstruction
3. Ischemic Bowel
4. Urinary Tract Infection
5. Exacerbation of GERD

Treatment:  Given the patient's presentation and CT findings, I recommend the following treatment plan for acute diverticulitis:

* **Bowel Rest:**  The patient should continue to avoid oral intake until symptoms improve.  IV fluids should be administered for hydration.
* **Antibiotics:**  Broad-spectrum antibiotics covering gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria should be initiated.  A combination of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole or amoxicillin-clavulanate is appropriate.

* **Surgical Consultation:**  Surgical consultation should be obtained if the patient's condition deteriorates, if there are signs of peritonitis, or if there is no improvement with medical management.
* **Address Incidental Findings:**  The adnexal cyst identified on the CT scan should be followed up with gynecology for further evaluation and management.
* **Management of Comorbidities:**  Continue to manage the patient's chronic conditions, including CHF, HTN, and DM.  Ensure appropriate medication adjustments are made as needed.
