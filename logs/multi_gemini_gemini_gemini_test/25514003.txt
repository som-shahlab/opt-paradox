HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ yr old male 8 mo sp lap gastric band.  Has 2 month hx of RUQ pain radiating to his epigastrum and back after fatty food intake.  Pt starts ___ min after ingestion and lasts ___ hrs.  ER work up has included US of RUQ which shows gallstones, CT  scan which shows possible duodenal diverticulum, KUB/CXR which shows band to be in good position.  Lab work up not consistent with acute infection or common bile duct stone.    Pt has not been compliant with a post band diet eating high fat content food and sweets. I did not inquire about his  exercise habits.  He has lost 31lbs since entiring the weight loss  program and has been able to keep it off.    Past Medical History: HTN, Obesity, PTSD, Anxiety, Rt shoudler and Lt knee ligament  damage for which he takes Naproxen (PRN)    Social History: ___ Family History: FH: Non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain radiating to the epigastrum and back after fatty food intake, a common symptom of gallbladder issues. Given the presence of gallstones on ultrasound, cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis are possibilities. However, lab work does not indicate acute infection or common bile duct stones. The patient's history of gastric band placement introduces additional complexity. While the band appears to be in good position, it could be contributing to altered digestive processes. The patient's non-compliance with a post-band diet, particularly the consumption of high-fat foods, is a significant factor to consider.  I need more information about the specifics of the pain, the patient's dietary habits, and any associated symptoms to better understand the clinical picture.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Murphy's sign, assessment for abdominal tenderness and distension, auscultation of bowel sounds

ToolMessage:
"97.9 94 ___ Gen: well-appearing male, appears younger than stated age, NAD, no icterus, somnolent HEENT: NC/AT, EOMI, PERRLA bilat., MMM, without cervical LAD on my exam Cor: RRR without m/g/r, no JVD, no bruits Lungs: CTA bilat. ___: +BS, soft, ND, NT, no masses, no hernias Ext: warm feet, no edema"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RUQ pain after fatty food intake, combined with the ultrasound finding of gallstones, strongly suggests gallbladder pathology. The absence of lab findings consistent with acute infection or common bile duct stones lowers the likelihood of acute cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis, but doesn't rule them out. The patient's non-compliance with a post-band diet and consumption of high-fat foods could be exacerbating gallbladder symptoms. The physical exam findings do not reveal acute distress, but the documented somnolence could be related to pain medication or other factors.  The presence of bowel sounds suggests normal intestinal activity.  While a duodenal diverticulum is a possibility based on the CT scan, the primary suspicion remains gallbladder-related given the classic symptoms and presence of gallstones.  I will proceed with a diagnosis of symptomatic cholelithiasis exacerbated by dietary indiscretion.

5. Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction

Treatment:
1. **Dietary Modification:** Strict adherence to a low-fat diet is crucial.  The patient should avoid fatty foods, fried foods, and sweets. Smaller, more frequent meals may be better tolerated.
