HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ M presents to ED with approximately 1 week days of abdominal  pain. Pain worse when moving. Much more constant over past 24 hrs and located on right side. Fever to 100.2 at home. Mild nausea, no emesis. Normal bowel movement without any relief of the pain. Never had pain like this before.    Past Medical History: PMH: stable angina, anxiety, depression, hypercholesterolemia, ED, low back pain, fungal umbilical infection PSH: tonsillectomy    Social History: ___ Family History: Noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's presentation with right-sided abdominal pain worsening with movement, fever, and nausea, appendicitis is a strong possibility. Other differentials include mesenteric adenitis, ovarian torsion (if female), or a kidney stone.  I need to gather more information through physical exam and lab tests to narrow down the diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on McBurney's point tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate

ToolMessage:
"NAD/A&Ox3 CTAB RRR Abd soft, minimally tender, nondistended Wounds: CDI"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right-sided abdominal pain, fever, and nausea, raising suspicion for appendicitis. While the physical exam findings are somewhat nonspecific, the minimal tenderness does not rule out appendicitis, especially early in the course.  Laboratory tests and imaging are necessary to further evaluate the patient's condition and confirm or rule out appendicitis and other potential diagnoses like mesenteric adenitis, ovarian torsion, or kidney stones.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, urinalysis, CRP

ToolMessage:
"I'll help you organize the results for the requested tests:  CBC with differential: - White Blood Cells: 17.4 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 4.98 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 15.3 g/dL - Hematocrit: 42.5% - MCV: 86.0 fL - MCH: 30.8 pg - MCHC: 36.0% - RDW: 13.6% - Platelet Count: 213.0 K/uL - Differential:   - Neutrophils: 87.5%   - Lymphocytes: 7.4%   - Monocytes: 4.0%   - Eosinophils: 0.5%   - Basophils: 0.6%  CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel): - Sodium: 136.0 mEq/L - Potassium: 3.7 mEq/L - Chloride: 96.0 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 29.0 mEq/L - Glucose: NEG mg/dL - Urea Nitrogen: 17.0 mg/dL - Creatinine: 1.2 mg/dL - ALT: 24.0 IU/L - AST: 30.0 IU/L - Total Bilirubin: 2.1 mg/dL - Alkaline Phosphatase: 76.0 IU/L  Urinalysis: - Color: Straw - Appearance: Clear - Specific Gravity: 1.034 - pH: 7.0 units - Protein: NEG - Glucose: NEG - Ketones: NEG - Blood: NEG - Leukocytes: NEG - Nitrite: NEG - Urobilinogen: NEG - Bilirubin: NEG  CRP (C-Reactive Protein): This test result is not available in the provided data."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of right lower quadrant pain, fever, and elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia strongly suggests appendicitis.  While the abdominal exam showed minimal tenderness, this does not definitively rule out appendicitis. Imaging is crucial to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  STUDY: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast; coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also generated.  FINDINGS:  The visualized portion of the heart and lungs appears unremarkable. The liver shows no evidence of a focal lesion or biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is normal appearing without evidence of stones or wall thickening. The spleen is normal in size and appearance. The pancreas is normal appearing. The adrenal glands are normal bilaterally. The kidneys enhance with and excrete contrast symmetrically. Within the mid pole of the right kidney, there are two well-circumscribed fluid densities measuring 22 and 18 mm in diameter respectively (2; 23 and 32), compatible with simple cysts. The aorta, portal vein, IVC and their major branches all appear patent. The small intestine shows no evidence of obstruction or wall thickening.  PELVIS: The bladder and prostate appear unremarkable. Sigmoid diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis is seen in the right lower quadrant. The appendix is noted to be fluid filled and dilated, measuring 9 mm in diameter. At the junction between the appendix and the cecum, there is a well-circumscribed dense intraluminal structure measuring 8 x 3 mm, compatible with an appendicolith (301B; 26). There is fat stranding surrounding this inflamed appendix. There are no locules of free air to suggest perforation.  BONES: There is grade 1 retrolisthesis of L2 on L3. Moderate degenerative changes are seen throughout the lumbosacral spine. No lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a history of right lower quadrant pain, fever, and elevated white blood cell count. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, demonstrating a dilated appendix with an appendicolith and surrounding fat stranding.  The patient also has simple renal cysts and sigmoid diverticulosis, which are incidental findings. The retrolisthesis and degenerative changes in the lumbosacral spine are also noted but unrelated to the current abdominal pain. Based on the clinical picture and imaging findings, the patient has acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a history of right lower quadrant pain, fever, and nausea.  The initial physical exam was relatively benign.  Lab results showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, demonstrating a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with an appendicolith and surrounding fat stranding.  The absence of free air suggests no perforation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Ovarian Torsion (if female)
4. Kidney Stone
5. Diverticulitis

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy. Given the imaging findings without perforation, a laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred approach.  Preoperatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin, or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole). Postoperatively, the patient should receive pain management, continue antibiotics as indicated, and be monitored for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  The patient should be educated on wound care and follow-up appointments.
