HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___. female with acute onset severe ___ diffuse abdominal  pain that started off afternoon prior to admission and  progressed over the course of the evening.  Associated with  nausea/vomiting.  Last BM was 8pm preceding night, normal, no  blood, no diarrhea.  Never had pain like this before.  No  dysuria.  No fevers, +chills.   Past Medical History: Asthma, seasonal allergies.  Denies surgical history.   Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute severe diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  The acuity and severity warrant investigation for serious causes like appendicitis, bowel obstruction, cholecystitis, or pancreatitis.  Chills without fever could suggest an infectious process.  Given the lack of specific localizing symptoms, a broad initial workup is needed.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has significant leukocytosis with neutrophilia, suggesting an infectious or inflammatory process.  The slightly elevated potassium may be related to dehydration from vomiting or a spurious lab result due to hemolysis during blood draw.  Ketones in the urine suggest possible dehydration or diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), though the glucose is negative.  The negative glucose could be a lab error or indicate euglycemic DKA.  Amylase and beta-hCG are still needed to complete the initial assessment.  An abdominal CT is indicated to further evaluate the cause of the abdominal pain.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute severe diffuse abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, along with leukocytosis and neutrophilia, raises concern for an intra-abdominal infectious or inflammatory process.  The presence of ketones in the urine with a negative glucose is unusual and requires further investigation to rule out euglycemic DKA.  While amylase and beta-hCG results are still pending, an abdominal CT is necessary to visualize the abdominal organs and identify any source of the pain and inflammation.  Even if the amylase and beta-hCG results return normal, the CT scan is still warranted given the patient's clinical picture.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast matches the available CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained from the bases of the lung to the pubis symphysis after administration of IV and p.o. contrast. The patient did not tolerate p.o. contrast well and despite premedicated with anti-emetics. Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained for evaluation.  FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear. The liver is normal without focal lesions. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. There is prompt exclusion of IV contrast into the collecting system. No hydronephrosis is noted. The stomach and duodenum are normal. Mild-to-moderate amount of ascites is noted in the perihepatic and perisplenic regions, and also dispersed in the mesentery. There is no free air or lymphadenopathy in the intra-abdominal cavity.  CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: In image 2:58, there is a focal dense material, adjacent to a speck of air. Given the proximity to the cecum, this likely represent an appendicolith. There is a distended tubular structure containing this appendicolith, measuring 14 mm in diameter, likely represent a fluid-filled appendix. There is no evidence of extraluminal air or periappendiceal fluid collection. There is however ascites and periotoneal enhancment. Of note, there are loops of fluid-filled small bowel in the vicinity, which are distinct from this fluid-filled appendix. Oral contrast is only seen reaching the mid jejunum. No small bowel abnormality is noted. The uterus is normal in size. There is normal follicular activity in the adnexae. A mild-to-moderate amount of free fluid is noted in the deep pelvis.  BONE WINDOW: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are noted."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with acute severe diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and chills.  Initial labs showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and ketonuria.  The CT scan reveals a distended fluid-filled appendix with an appendicolith, consistent with acute appendicitis.  The presence of ascites and peritoneal enhancement suggests inflammation and possible early perforation.  The lack of extraluminal air or periappendiceal fluid collection suggests that the appendicitis is not yet complicated by a large abscess.  The oral contrast reaching only the mid-jejunum could be due to the patient's vomiting or could indicate partial small bowel obstruction, which could be related to the appendicitis.  The patient's presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging results are consistent with acute appendicitis.
