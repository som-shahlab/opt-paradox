HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ presenting with ~10 days of RLQ pain, nausea, anorexia. He states the pain was never severe and he kept on working last week despite it. It is mostly in the RLQ and lower abdomen. He has been nauseated throughout and vomited once 3 days ago.  Denies fevers or chills, has been having normal bowel movements and no urinary symptoms. Last ___ he went to see his PCP for the pain who checked labs (normal), gave Zantac and suggested a CT  if the pain persists. However the patient never went to the ED, and has been mostly plagued by the anorexia and malaise, a feeling  of being generally not well, rather than the pain. He finally decided to present today since symptoms were not resolving, pain was persisting.      Past Medical History: Past Medical History: HTN, allergic rhinitis, eczema, external hemorrhoids, tinea pedis   Past Surgical History: shrapnel removal from the leg while in the army    Social History: ___ Family History: Noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, nausea, anorexia, and malaise for ~10 days. While the patient denies fevers or chills, and reports normal bowel movements and no urinary symptoms, the persistence of RLQ pain raises concern for appendicitis.  Given the duration of symptoms, there's also a possibility of a developing abscess or other complications.  The normal labs from the PCP visit are helpful but further evaluation is needed.  A CT scan is warranted to assess the appendix and surrounding structures.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired from the lung bases through the pubic symphysis following administration of intravenous contrast with multiplanar reformations.  CT ABDOMEN: The lung bases are clear with the exception of dependent atelectasis. The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. The liver demonstrates no focal lesion. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance symmetrically without hydronephrosis or hydroureter. Small bowel loops are completely collapsed, in keeping with history of oral intolerance. The colon is not dilated. Note is made of sudden caliber change near the splenic flexure (2, 26 and 300B, 15), which could be related to peristalsis, however once acute issues resolve, this should be further assessed by colonoscopy to exclude a subtle mass. The appendix is hyperemic and enlarged with significant surrounding stranding and dilatation up to 19 mm in maximal diameter associated with a tip periappendiceal phlegmon/abscess measuring 1.8 x 1.6 cm. There is no frank free air. There is minimal if any secondary thickening involving the cecal tip. Great vessels are patent. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy by size criteria.  CT PELVIS: The bladder, distal ureters, prostate, and rectum appear within normal limits. There is no inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymphadenopathy. No free fluid within the pelvis.  BONE WINDOW: No focal concerning lesion."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with persistent RLQ pain, nausea, anorexia, and malaise, along with the CT findings of a hyperemic and enlarged appendix with surrounding stranding, a periappendiceal phlegmon/abscess, and dilated appendix measuring 19mm in diameter, strongly suggests a diagnosis of acute appendicitis with a periappendiceal abscess. The collapsed small bowel loops are consistent with the patient's anorexia and oral intolerance. While the sudden caliber change near the splenic flexure noted on the CT scan warrants further investigation with a colonoscopy after the acute issue resolves, it is not the immediate concern.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis with periappendiceal abscess
2. Appendicitis
3. Cecal mass (to be ruled out by colonoscopy)
4. Gastroenteritis
5. Mesenteric adenitis

Treatment: The patient requires prompt surgical intervention for the appendiceal abscess. This will likely involve laparoscopic or open appendectomy with drainage of the abscess.  Intravenous antibiotics should be administered to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.  The patient should be kept NPO and receive IV fluids for hydration.  Pain management should be addressed.  Post-operatively, the patient should be monitored for complications such as wound infection, intra-abdominal abscess, and ileus.  After recovery from the appendectomy, a colonoscopy should be scheduled to evaluate the sudden caliber change near the splenic flexure identified on CT.
