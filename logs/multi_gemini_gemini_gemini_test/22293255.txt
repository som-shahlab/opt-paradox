HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ M w/ RLQ pain, woke him from sleep early the morning of  admission. Sharp, constant, no migration. No fever or chills. Had diarrhea the night before admission after clam chowder but no diarrhea  day of admission. Minimal nausea DOA, no vomiting. Last meal  night before admission. Is hungry.   Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: Noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of sharp, constant right lower quadrant (RLQ) pain that woke him from sleep is concerning for appendicitis.  The preceding diarrhea after clam chowder could be unrelated or could be due to gastroenteritis.  Given the location and character of the pain, it's important to rule out appendicitis first.  I need to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness to better localize the pain.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign, Rebound tenderness,  Guarding, rigidity, Auscultation of bowel sounds

ToolMessage:
"Admission  Vitals: 98.4  79  124/87  16  100% RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR  PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender RLQ. Positive Rovsing's sign. Negative psoas sign. No shake or heel strike tenderness.  ."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, positive Rovsing's sign, and tenderness in the RLQ strongly suggests appendicitis.  While the lack of fever, chills, and anorexia are atypical, they do not rule out appendicitis.  The patient's recent diarrhea could be a separate issue, but it's important to consider the possibility of an atypical presentation of appendicitis.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast would help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of RLQ pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast report from the available studies. Here is the complete report:  CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained from the base of the lungs to pubic symphysis after administration of 130 cc of nonionic intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were prepared and reviewed.  FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is an inflammed blind-ending tubular structure in the right lower quadrant measuring approximately 11 mm in diameter with evidence of hyperdense material both at its origin and within it (601b:28, 30), consistent with appendicoliths. These findings are consistent with ____. There is no evidence of free air. No drainable fliud collection is seen. The visualized lung bases are clear. The visualized heart is without pericardial effusion. The liver, gallbladder, bilateral adrenal glands, spleen, pancreas, and bilateral kidneys are normal. No bowel obstruction is seen. The aorta is normal in caliber and contour. There is no free fluid or free air throughout the abdomen. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: Aside from the aforementioned ____, the bladder, prostate, rectum, and sigmoid colon are normal. There is no free fluid or free air throughout the pelvis. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions suspicious for malignancy."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing an inflamed appendix with appendicoliths.  The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT results are consistent with acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute RLQ pain, tenderness at McBurney's point, a positive Rovsing's sign, and the CT scan confirms an inflamed appendix with appendicoliths. This confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  Although the patient lacks some typical symptoms like fever and anorexia, the clinical picture and imaging are definitive.  The diarrhea he experienced the day prior was likely unrelated.  The appropriate treatment is appendectomy.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Mesenteric adenitis
4. Typhlitis
5. Right ureteral calculus

Treatment:  Appendectomy, either laparoscopic or open, is indicated.  Preoperatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem, or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole).  Postoperatively, the patient should receive pain control, continue antibiotics as indicated based on intraoperative findings and clinical course, and be monitored for complications such as surgical site infection or intra-abdominal abscess.  The patient should be advised to avoid heavy lifting and strenuous activity for several weeks following surgery.
