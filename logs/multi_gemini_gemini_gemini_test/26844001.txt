Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with asthma, IDDM, GERD, fibromyalgia, HLD,  HTN, PUD, and anxiety presents with acute onset of epigastric  pain radiating around both flanks and to her right shoulder  blade. She reports having daily epigastric pain ___ GERD, but  two days ago she began having abdominal pain that was slightly  worse. She also reports increased flatulence, and mildly foul  taste in her mouth. Yesterday she had a small supper of an  omelette, and soon after began having severe epigastric pain  that came on quickly. It was ___ and worse than any pain she  had experienced before. Nothing made the pain better, and she  tried moving in all positions. It radiated around both sides to  her back and up under her right shoulder blade. She denies CP or  positional changes. She felt it was slightly worse with  breathing. She denies fever, shortness of breath. She had no  nausea, or vomitting, but her stomach did not feel well and she  had a bad taste in her mouth persistently. She feels it was  slightly relieved with prilosec. She had a bowel movement last  night that she described as "yellow" and has been passing gas  regularly. She had no melena, or blood in her stool. The pain  persisted overnight and was relieved slightly after hours of not  eating. She came to the ED this morning still in severe pain.   She denies any history of gall stones, and does not drink  alcohol. She denies any history of hypercalcemia but does have  hyperlipidemia. She reports that last week she had elevated BP  related to stress and was taking hydrochlorothiazide more often  than regularly. She usually only takes ___ a tablet when she has  edema, but last week she took a full tab every day, which is  "more than I ever take."  In the ED, initial vs were T 97.6, HR 70, BP 203/84, RR 18, O2  99% on RA. She received atenolol for her elevated BP. Given  chest pain, had cardiac work up: EKG showed no change from  previous and initial troponins were negative. Found to have  elevated lipase and started on IVF, patient refused pain meds.  RUQ ultrasound was limited by body habitus but showed a normal  gall bladder with no distention or stones. Transfer VS T 97.9,  HR 60, BP 185/70, RR 14, O2 100% on RA  On arrival to the floor, patient reports that her pain is much  improved with oxycodone. She denies any headache or vision  changes, and reports her elevated BP is about where it has been  at home.      REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: Denies fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes,  rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath,  chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, BRBPR,  melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.  All other 10-system review negative in detail.   Past Medical History: - GERD  - DM type 2 - HLD  - HTN - Peptic ulcer disease  - Diverticulosis - Diverticulitis treated medically - Anxiety  - Asthma  - DJD - Osteoarthritis  - Chronic hives - LBP - Obesity - Fibromyalgia - Irritable bowel syndrome  - Herpes simplex   Social History: ___ Family History: Mother - ___ cancer, GERD Father - ___ died of a blood clot. Intractable HTN since he was  ___. CAD


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric pain radiating to the back and right shoulder, concerning for pancreatitis or biliary disease.  Her history of GERD, PUD, and recent increased hydrochlorothiazide use also raise suspicion for a GI bleed or medication-induced gastritis. The elevated lipase supports pancreatitis, but the limited ultrasound doesn't rule out biliary pathology.  I need further information to differentiate between these possibilities and evaluate for other potential causes.

Thought: The patient's labs show elevated lipase, confirming pancreatitis.  The absence of gallstones on the limited ultrasound, normal liver function tests, and normal triglycerides make gallstone pancreatitis and hypertriglyceridemia less likely.  The elevated glucose and ketones in urine suggest poorly controlled diabetes, which could be contributing to her symptoms.  The slightly elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia is consistent with an inflammatory process like pancreatitis.  I have enough information to make a reasonable conclusion.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Pancreatitis
2. Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
3. Gastritis
4. Peptic Ulcer Disease exacerbation
5. Biliary colic

Treatment:
* **For Acute Pancreatitis:**
    * NPO status initially, then advance to a low-fat diet as tolerated.
    * Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation with isotonic crystalloids (e.g., Lactated Ringer's) to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance.
    * Pain management with IV opioids (e.g., hydromorphone or morphine) as needed.
    * Close monitoring of vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.
    * Frequent laboratory assessments, including lipase, amylase, CBC, CMP, and blood glucose.
* **For DKA:**
    * IV insulin infusion to correct hyperglycemia and ketosis.
    * Electrolyte monitoring and replacement, particularly potassium, as needed.
    * Continue IV fluids as needed.
* **Other:**
    * Monitor for complications of pancreatitis, such as pseudocysts, abscesses, and necrosis.
    * Address underlying causes if identified (e.g., hypertriglyceridemia, gallstones).
    * Educate the patient on lifestyle modifications, including dietary changes and alcohol cessation (if applicable).
    * Evaluate and manage the patient's other comorbidities, including GERD, PUD, HTN, and IDDM.  Adjust hydrochlorothiazide use as needed based on blood pressure and electrolyte levels.
    * Consider a CT scan of the abdomen if the diagnosis remains uncertain or if complications are suspected.
