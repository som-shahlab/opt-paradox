HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of depression, anxiety, asthma, eczema, and severe hidradenitis suppurativa s/p multiple rectal surgeries, who presents with diarrhea and abdominal pain for 1 month.  He reports that the diarrhea started approximately 1 month ago. He is having up to 15-stools per day, described as "rust  colored" and occasionally with small amounts of blood. He was seen  ___ at ___ where he was diagnosed with colitis by CT scan. He was discharged on a 7-day course of ciprofloxacin which he  completed, however he states the diarrhea persisted. He also has noted diffuse lower abdominal pain, particularly in the LLQ, described as sharp/stabbing and intermittent but daily. The pain has not improved with Tramadol and tizanidine. He does not feel like his current pain and symptoms are similar to the prior times he has had rectal and perirectal abscesses. He started feeling subjectively warm and had two episodes of non-bloody,  non-bilious vomiting ___ days prior to admission. He is now concerned that  he "is septic." Does not report fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, or urinary symptoms. He does not report any antibiotics prior to the diarrhea or any recent travel or abnormal ingestions.  In the ED, initial VS were:  98.8 107 149/97 18 98% RA. Exam notable for: General - comfortable, non-toxic, no acute distress GI - abdomen soft, diffuse tenderness most pronounced in the  LLQ, no rebound or guarding, bowel sounds active, well-healed colostomy scar to the left of midline Rectal - large area of erythema with multiple superficial abrasions around rectum, very tender to palpation, no palpable mass or fluctuant mass, no purulent drainage  Labs showed:  WBC 13.9, 74% PMNs. Cr 0.8, HCO3 25, K 4.4. LFTs wnl. negative UA.  Imaging showed:  CT A/P: 1. Wall thickening and significant  fatty stranding of the distal descending and proximal sigmoid colon over an 11 cm segment consistent with colitis. Given pattern and extent of inflammation, colonoscopy should be performed after treatment. 2. Foci of air noted adjacent to the bowel more likely to be in diverticula rather than microperforation. 3. No drainable fluid collections are noted.  Surgery was consulted and stated: No acute surgical issues.  Would recommend admit to medicine for monitoring, NPO, GI workup for IBD, ABx, C.diff testing.  Patient received: 1L IVF, 4 mg IV morphine x 3, IV  Ciprofloxacin, Simvastatin 40 mg, 2 mg lorazepam, 50 mg atenolol, 25 mg diphenhydramine, 4 mg IV Zofran.  Transfer VS were:  98.3 81 118/62 18 94% RA.  On arrival to the floor, patient confirmed the above history. He is currently most bothered by his rectal pain, which he states  is severe. It will occur after a bowel movement and last for  several hours. Given the frequency of his bowel movements, the pain generally does not go away. On review of systems, does not  report fevers, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and changes in bladder habits.      Past Medical History: Hidradenitis suppurativa DM Eczema Depression HTN HLD Panic attacks   Social History: ___ Family History: Father: Multiple myeloma and lymphoma Mother: ___ cancer


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain despite a course of ciprofloxacin. The CT scan suggests colitis, and there's a recommendation for a colonoscopy. Given the patient's history of hidradenitis suppurativa and multiple rectal surgeries, it's important to consider other potential causes of his symptoms, including infectious colitis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and complications related to his prior surgeries.  Further information is needed to narrow down the diagnosis.
Action: laboratory tests

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms persist despite a course of ciprofloxacin, and the CT scan findings are suggestive of colitis.  The elevated WBC count suggests an inflammatory process.  While infectious causes are still possible, the lack of improvement with antibiotics raises the suspicion for IBD.  The patient's history of hidradenitis suppurativa further supports this possibility, as there is an association between the two conditions.  The severe rectal pain, particularly after bowel movements, needs further evaluation.  A colonoscopy is recommended to visualize the colon and obtain biopsies to confirm the diagnosis.
