HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old HIV + male presented with periumbilical pain onset 1  day that radiated 6 hours after to the RLQ. The pain was  constant in nature and asociated with nausea, various episode on  bilious vomiting and anorexia.     Past Medical History: PMH: HIV  PSH: testicular orchiopexy, teeth extraction    Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, suggesting appendicitis.  Given the patient's HIV status, it's crucial to consider opportunistic infections and other differentials like CMV, TB, or lymphoma. A thorough physical exam and basic labs are needed to assess the current status and guide further investigation.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound, guarding, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign),  lymph node exam (cervical, axillary, inguinal)

ToolMessage:
"Physical Exam on Admission  Vitals: Afebrile, HDS GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Highly  tender at ___, non distended Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused  Physical Exam"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's tenderness at ___ in the RLQ, along with nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, further increases the suspicion for appendicitis. However, given the patient's HIV status, it's still important to rule out other infectious or inflammatory causes.  Laboratory tests are needed to assess for infection/inflammation and evaluate organ function.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, lipase, urinalysis, HIV viral load and CD4 count

ToolMessage:
"I'll help you organize the available results for the requested tests:  CBC with differential: - White Blood Cells: 13.3 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 5.12 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 15.9 g/dL - Hematocrit: 46.6% - MCV: 91.0 fL - MCH: 31.0 pg - MCHC: 34.0% - RDW: 12.2% - Platelet Count: 232.0 K/uL - Neutrophils: 93.1% - Lymphocytes: 4.7% - Monocytes: 1.9% - Eosinophils: 0.1% - Basophils: 0.2%  CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel): - Sodium: 139.0 mEq/L - Potassium: 4.3 mEq/L - Chloride: 101.0 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 27.0 mEq/L - Urea Nitrogen: 13.0 mg/dL - Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL - Albumin: 4.8 g/dL - Bilirubin, Total: 0.3 mg/dL - Alkaline Phosphatase: 75.0 IU/L - ALT: 42.0 IU/L - AST: 27.0 IU/L  Lipase: 22.0 IU/L  Urinalysis: - Appearance: Clear - Color: Straw - Specific Gravity: 1.015 - pH: 6.0 units - Protein: Negative - Glucose: Negative - Ketones: Negative - Blood: Negative - Nitrite: Negative - Leukocytes: Negative - Bilirubin: Negative - Urobilinogen: Negative  HIV viral load and CD4 count: Results not available in the provided data."

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and lab results (leukocytosis with neutrophilia) are highly suggestive of acute appendicitis.  While the HIV status warrants consideration of other diagnoses, the current information points strongly towards appendicitis as the most likely cause. Obtaining an abdominal CT scan would help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal CT with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the CT Abdomen with IV contrast portion of the report. Here it is:  CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Minimal atelectatic changes are noted at the lung bases. The heart is normal in size without a pericardial effusion. The appendix appears dilated up to 14 mm with wall thickening and mild surrounding inflammatory changes suggestive of acute uncomplicated ____. There is no evidence of perforation. A small hiatal hernia is noted. Otherwise, the stomach and remainder of the visualized loops of small and large bowel are within normal limits. The liver, spleen, pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands, and bilateral kidneys are within normal limits. There are cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber and contour."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, combined with physical exam findings of tenderness at ___, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and a CT scan showing a dilated appendix with wall thickening and surrounding inflammation confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The CT scan also ruled out other potential intra-abdominal pathologies.  Although the patient is HIV positive, the clinical picture is consistent with uncomplicated appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute uncomplicated appendicitis, with a dilated appendix, wall thickening, and surrounding inflammation.  The absence of perforation is reassuring.  The patient's HIV status should be considered in post-operative management, ensuring appropriate antibiotic coverage and monitoring for potential complications.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Typhlitis
4. Epiploic Appendagitis
5. Diverticulitis

Treatment: Appendectomy is the definitive treatment for acute appendicitis.  Given the uncomplicated nature, a laparoscopic approach is preferred.  Peri-operative antibiotics should be administered, covering gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole).  Post-operative pain management and early ambulation are important.  The patient's HIV status should be closely monitored, and antiretroviral therapy should be continued/optimized as needed.  Discharge instructions should include wound care, pain management, and follow-up with both the surgeon and the HIV specialist.
