HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old female new periumbilical pain that started at 10pm,  with progression of pain to the RLQ. Denies fevers and chills. She endorses nausea, anorexia and 1 episode of emesis.  Throughout she has had normal bowel movements.     Past Medical History: depression    Social History: ___ Family History: Adopted


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Periumbilical pain migrating to the RLQ is a classic presentation of appendicitis.  Given the nausea, anorexia, and emesis, appendicitis is high on the differential. I need to gather more information to assess for peritoneal signs and confirm the suspected diagnosis.  Knowing the patient's age is important for risk stratification, as is surgical history to understand prior abdominal surgeries.  Family history is less relevant given the patient's adoption status, but social history including smoking status is relevant for surgical planning.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam with assessment for guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign, McBurney's point tenderness;  assess for Murphy's sign

ToolMessage:
"upon admission ___ Temp: 99 HR: 73 BP: 109/62 Resp: 18 O(2)Sat: 99 Normal Constitutional:   Constitutional: comfortable Head/ Eyes: NC/AT ENT: OP WNL Resp: CTAB Cards: RRR. s1,s2. no MRG. Abd: RLQ tenderness Flank: no CVAT Skin: no rash Ext: No c/c/e Neuro: speech fluent Psych: normal mood"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with periumbilical pain migrating to the RLQ, accompanied by nausea, anorexia, and one episode of emesis, which are highly suggestive of appendicitis.  The physical exam reveals RLQ tenderness, further supporting this diagnosis. While the patient's temperature is only slightly elevated, the absence of fever does not rule out appendicitis.  A slightly elevated white blood cell count would further support the diagnosis.  Given the concerning presentation and physical exam findings, I would proceed with imaging to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential

ToolMessage:
"I'll provide the Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential results from the available data:  White Blood Cell Count: 16.3 K/uL Red Blood Cell Count: 3.91 m/uL Hemoglobin: 11.9 g/dL Hematocrit: 34.8% Platelet Count: 143.0 K/uL MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume): 89.0 fL MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin): 30.4 pg MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration): 34.2 g/dL RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width): 11.9%  Differential: - Neutrophils: 88.5% (Absolute: 14.39 K/uL) - Lymphocytes: 6.0% (Absolute: 0.97 K/uL) - Monocytes: 4.7% (Absolute: 0.76 K/uL) - Eosinophils: 0.1% (Absolute: 0.01 K/uL) - Basophils: 0.2% (Absolute: 0.04 K/uL) - Immature Granulocytes: 0.5%  All components of the CBC with differential are available in the data set."

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of migrating periumbilical pain to the RLQ, combined with nausea, anorexia, emesis, and RLQ tenderness, strongly suggests appendicitis.  The elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia further supports this diagnosis. The patient also has a mild anemia.  Although not diagnostic, it could be explained by blood loss or chronic disease.  Imaging is now indicated to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis and evaluate for other potential causes of abdominal pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast report from the available studies. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Images obtained at an outside institution was made available for review.  DOSE:  Acquisition sequence:     1) Stationary Acquisition 6.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 28.9 mGy (Body) DLP = 14.4 mGy-cm.     2) Spiral Acquisition 4.9 s, 53.9 cm; CTDIvol = 11.2 mGy (Body) DLP = 603.0 mGy-cm.   Total DLP (Body) = 617 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:    LOWER CHEST: Atelectasis is minimal in bilateral lung bases posteriorly.  ABDOMEN:    HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. Several scattered millimetric hypodensities in the liver are too small to be fully characterized, however statistically likely represent cysts or biliary hamartomas. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. 1.6 cm cyst is noted at mid right kidney. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: There is a predominately hypoattenuating 3.5 cm lobulated mass is identified adjacent to the greater curvature of the stomach (02:11) with peripheral areas of relatively increased attenuation (601:24). This is closely related to the greater curve of the stomach but forms a relatively acute angle suggesting this may be extrinsic to the stomach versus submucosal. No definite contiguity with the liver is seen, however this could represent an exophytic hemangioma. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. Appendix is enlarged, with maximum diameter measuring 9 mm. 3 mm hyperdensity at the base of appendix may represent obstructing appendicolith (2:61).  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. Small amount of free fluid is noted in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Uterus is unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Degenerative changes are noted at L5-S1.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  NOTIFICATION: The updated wet read and recommendation were discussed with Dr. ___. by ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 10:08 am, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, laboratory results, and CT scan findings all point to acute appendicitis. The CT scan confirms an enlarged appendix with an appendicolith, which is the likely cause of the obstruction and inflammation. The presence of free fluid in the pelvis is also concerning and suggests possible perforation or localized peritonitis.  The incidental finding of a 3.5 cm lobulated mass adjacent to the greater curvature of the stomach requires further investigation, but is unlikely to be related to the patient's current symptoms.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**

Treatment: The patient requires emergent surgical consultation for appendectomy.
