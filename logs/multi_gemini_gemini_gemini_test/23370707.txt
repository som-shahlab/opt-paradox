HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This is an otherwise healthy ___ year-old gentleman presenting  with abdominal pain. Patient states he woke earlier this morning  with severe periumbilical pain which later shifted to the right  lower quadrant, cramping, without alleviating or exacerbating  factors. Denies concomitant symptoms such as fever, chills,  nausea or emesis. Given worsening pain, he presented to our hospital for further evaluation and management   Past Medical History: Past medical history: None  Past surgical history: Excision of left forehead skin lesion as a child    Social History: ___ Family History: nc


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to the right lower quadrant, a classic presentation for appendicitis.  However, to make an informed decision, I need to know the patient's age, vital signs, and perform a physical exam to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign), assessment for guarding and rebound tenderness

ToolMessage:
"Vital Signs: Temp 98, Pulse 85, BP 100/43, RR 16, O2 sat 99% RA General: A&Ox3, NAD HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, sclerae anicteric, oropharynx clear, MMM,  supple neck, no cervical LAD Cardiac: RRR, no M/G/R Resp: breathing comfortably, CTAB, no W/R/R Abd: soft, appropriately tender with no rebound or guarding,  non-distended, NABS; no erythema, fluctuance, or induration  around dressing sites Extr: 2+ peripheral pulses, WWP, no C/C/E, moves all limbs  spontaneously"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of migrating abdominal pain, now localized to the RLQ, along with focal tenderness on exam concerning for appendicitis.  The patient is otherwise healthy and afebrile with normal vital signs.  While the abdominal exam doesn't reveal rebound, guarding, or rigidity, McBurney's point tenderness raises suspicion. To definitively rule out appendicitis and evaluate for other potential causes of abdominal pain, imaging is necessary.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired through abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. Oral contrast was administered.  DOSE: DLP: 451.82 to mGy-cm. IV Contrast: 130 mL Omnipaque  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: The bases of the lungs are clear. There is no nodule, consolidation, or pleural effusion. The base the heart is normal in size. There is no pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: The liver is normal in shape and contour. No focal hepatic lesion is identified. The portal veins are patent. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilation. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys are normal without renal lesions, hydronephrosis, or pyelonephritis. They enhance excrete contrast symmetrically.  The stomach and small bowel are normal in course and caliber. There is no evidence of obstruction. There are no focal inflammatory changes. No free air or free fluid is identified. The abdominal vasculature is normal in caliber. There is no mesenteric, retroperitoneum, or periportal lymphadenopathy.  PELVIS: The appendix is mildly dilated, measuring 10 mm, with wall hyperemia and minimal surrounding stranding. There is no evidence of surrounding free air or an abscess formation.  Mild wall thickening is seen in the base of the cecum. This is compatible with acute uncomplicated ____.  The large bowel is normal without focal inflammatory changes or evidence of a mass. The bladder and prostate are unremarkable. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. No free fluid is identified in the pelvis.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES AND SOFT TISSUES: There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions. A 7 mm sclerotic focus in the right acetabulum (2, 74) is likely a bone island. No fracture is identified.  There are no significant degenerative changes. The soft tissues are unremarkable. There is no hernia."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT scan demonstrating a mildly dilated appendix with wall hyperemia and minimal surrounding stranding confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The cecum also shows mild wall thickening.  There are no signs of perforation or abscess formation, suggesting uncomplicated appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of migrating RLQ pain, focal tenderness, and the CT findings of a dilated appendix with wall hyperemia and periappendiceal stranding confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The absence of an abscess or free air suggests uncomplicated appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Cecal inflammation/Typhlitis (secondary to appendicitis)
3. Mesenteric adenitis
4. Gastroenteritis
5. Constipation

Treatment:  The patient should undergo laparoscopic appendectomy.  Preoperatively, administer IV fluids and antibiotics with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole). Postoperatively, continue IV fluids and antibiotics until the patient is tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, and demonstrating improvement in pain control.  Pain management should be multimodal, including opioids and NSAIDs as tolerated.  The patient should be monitored for complications such as surgical site infection, intra-abdominal abscess, and bowel obstruction.  Discharge instructions should include wound care, pain management, activity restrictions, and follow-up with a surgeon.
