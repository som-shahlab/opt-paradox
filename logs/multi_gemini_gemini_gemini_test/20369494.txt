HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with three days of RUQ pain after eating ___ which  started in the RUQ and radiated to the epigastrium. She  initially presented to ___ three days ago where she  had elevated LFTs. Given concern for possible  choledocholithiasis she was transferred to ___. Per patient  report, she was managed non-operatively without intervention at  ___ and was discharged home. At home her RUQ pain returned and  was associated with subjective fevers, chills, nausea, and  vomiting.  She returned to ___ where she was again noted to  have elevated LFTs concerning for choledocholithiasis so was  transferred to ___ for further care.  Overall she is a poor  historian but is moving her bowels regularly. She has limited  herself to a non-fat diet to avoid pain.      Past Medical History: PMH: colitis of unknown etiology, diverticulitis, anxiety, depression  PSH: Tubal ligation, Ear surgery x2    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother had cholecystectomy, ___ with alcoholism


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with recurrent RUQ pain radiating to the epigastrium, associated with subjective fevers, chills, nausea, and vomiting.  Elevated LFTs raise concern for choledocholithiasis.  Given the recurrence of symptoms despite prior non-operative management, further investigation is needed to determine the cause of her symptoms and guide appropriate management.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show elevated alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, total and direct bilirubin, which are consistent with biliary obstruction or hepatocellular injury.  The normal lipase makes pancreatitis less likely.  The low potassium likely reflects the patient's vomiting.  Given the recurrent RUQ pain, history of elevated LFTs concerning for choledocholithiasis, and now these lab results, imaging is indicated to evaluate the biliary tree.
Action: imaging
Action Input: RUQ Ultrasound, MRCP

ToolMessage:
"Among the requested imaging studies (RUQ Ultrasound and MRCP), only the RUQ/Liver ultrasound is available in the provided list. Here is the full report:  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound): FINDINGS: The liver is homogenous in echotexture without discrete mass or lesion. No intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. Patient's gallbladder is present and multiple mobile gallstones are identified. The gallbladder is not distended nor is there any pericholecystic fluid. On a few provided images, gallbladder wall appears thickened whereas in other images it appears of normal diameter. Occasional thickened appearance is likely related to non-distended state. Common bile duct is not dilated measuring 4 mm. The very distal aspect of the pancreatic tail is excluded from view due to bowel gas; however, the visualized parts are unremarkable. Demonstrated portions of the right kidney, inferior vena cava and aorta are normal. No free fluid identified.  The MRCP is not available in the provided list of imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's RUQ ultrasound shows gallstones and a normal common bile duct.  The elevated LFTs and bilirubin suggest biliary obstruction or hepatocellular injury. While the ultrasound did not show common bile duct dilation, a small stone could be intermittently obstructing the cystic duct, leading to recurrent symptoms.  Given the patient's history and persistent symptoms, an MRCP is still warranted to definitively rule out choledocholithiasis and further evaluate the biliary tree.  If the MRCP is negative, other causes of the elevated LFTs should be considered, such as medication-induced liver injury or autoimmune hepatitis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: MRCP

ToolMessage:
"The requested MRCP is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. The only available imaging study is a Liver/Gallbladder Ultrasound."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's RUQ ultrasound shows gallstones and a normal common bile duct.  The elevated LFTs and bilirubin, combined with the recurrent RUQ pain after eating, suggest biliary disease, likely related to the gallstones. While the ultrasound did not show common bile duct dilation, a small stone could be intermittently obstructing the cystic duct, leading to recurrent symptoms.  Given the persistent and recurrent nature of the patient's symptoms despite prior non-operative management, and the lack of access to MRCP to definitively rule out choledocholithiasis, a surgical consultation is warranted for consideration of cholecystectomy.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a classic picture of biliary colic with recurrent RUQ pain radiating to the epigastrium, triggered by fatty meals, and accompanied by nausea and vomiting.  The elevated LFTs, particularly the elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin, point towards biliary obstruction or hepatocellular injury.  The ultrasound confirms the presence of gallstones, but the common bile duct appears normal.  While an MRCP would be ideal to definitively rule out choledocholithiasis, it's unavailable.

Other possibilities include biliary dyskinesia or sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, but these are less likely given the typical presentation and the presence of gallstones.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Cholecystitis
2. Biliary Dyskinesia
3. Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction
4. Choledocholithiasis (less likely given normal CBD on ultrasound)
5. Medication-induced liver injury (less likely given the clear association with fatty meals)

Treatment:  Given the recurrent nature of the patient's symptoms and the presence of gallstones, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the recommended treatment.  The patient should be made NPO and started on IV fluids to correct the hypokalemia.  Pain control should be achieved with IV analgesics.  Pre-operative antibiotics should be administered.
