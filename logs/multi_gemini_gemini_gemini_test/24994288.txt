HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ presenting with 12 hrs of epigastric abdominal pain, nausea  and vomiting x1 the day prior. Pain was constant and sharp,  radiating to both flanks and back. Denies any fevers, chills or  diaphoresis. Has had normal bowel movements, last the previous  day. Patient has had similar self-limited RUQ/epigastric pain  episodes in the past since ___, but not as intense as this one.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Asthma Past Surgical History: None    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother died of lung cancer


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back and flanks, along with nausea and vomiting. This presentation suggests several possible diagnoses, including pancreatitis, cholecystitis, or even a perforated ulcer. Given the history of similar, less severe episodes, gallstones or biliary colic are also possible. To differentiate between these possibilities, I need more information about the patient's vital signs, laboratory results, and imaging findings.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show significantly elevated lipase and amylase, which strongly suggests acute pancreatitis.  The elevated ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase, along with the patient's history of recurrent RUQ/epigastric pain, raise the possibility of gallstone pancreatitis. The urinalysis showing elevated WBCs and leukocytes is consistent with this diagnosis.  I have enough information to make a reasonable conclusion.
