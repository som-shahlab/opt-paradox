HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ o/w healthy male with no significant PMH who presents with  abd pain. The patient reports having sudden onset abd pain after  his morning run yesterday. This pain began in the RLQ and was  associated with fevers, but no nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or  constipation. At bedside, Mr. ___ is lying in bed  comfortably with minimal pain at baseline. Options for both abx  and surgery discussed and he was enrolled in the ___ trail. WBC 10.1,  afebrile in ED.     Past Medical History: PMH: SEBORRHEIC DERMATITIS                                            SEBORRHEIC KERATOSIS                                              PSH: pilonidal cyst removal at age ___    Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain in the RLQ concerning for appendicitis. Given the patient's report of fever and elevated WBC, I need to gather more information to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign, rebound tenderness, abdominal guarding, assess for rigidity

ToolMessage:
"Admission    VS:  99.1  69  121/67   16   100% RA   Gen: Alert, oriented, in NAD  HEENT: EOMI, no palpable LAD    CV: RRR  Resp: CTAB, no inc WOB  Abd: Soft, minimally tender in RLQ, negative Rovsing's sign. no rebound tenderness or guarding.   Extrem: no c/c/e  Neuro: Grossly intact  Psyc: Appropriate mood/affect"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with RLQ pain, fever, and elevated WBC concerning for appendicitis. While the patient's abdominal exam currently shows minimal tenderness and negative Rovsing's sign, the initial symptoms are still suspicious.  Given the possibility of appendicitis and the risks associated with its progression, I would recommend imaging to further evaluate the appendix and surrounding structures.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 5.5 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 26.5 mGy (Body) DLP = 13.2 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 6.7 s, 53.1 cm; CTDIvol = 14.3 mGy (Body) DLP = 756.2 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 769 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is a simple left renal cyst measuring 1.3 cm. There is no evidence of concerning focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is dilated at the distal tip up to 1.0 cm (series 601, image 32), fluid-filled, with moderate adjacent mesenteric stranding. A mildly attenuating punctate focus at the mid appendix (series 601, image 34) is consistent with an appendicolith. There is a focal area of mural hypoenhancement (2: 52, 601:31), concerning for gangrenous cholecystitis. No discrete fluid collection or extraluminal air are demonstrated.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate and seminal vesicles are normal.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: A tiny umbilical hernia containing fat is noted."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with RLQ pain concerning for appendicitis.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with an appendicolith and surrounding mesenteric stranding.  There is also a concerning finding of mural hypoenhancement in the appendix, raising suspicion for gangrenous cholecystitis.
