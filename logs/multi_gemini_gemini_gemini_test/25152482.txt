Patient History:
This patient is a ___ year old female, who originally presented to OSH with 4 days of RUQ abd pain with associated fevers. Imaging there was remarkable for GB with thick wall and pericholecystic fluid, and pt was sent here for further management. Pt notes that she has not had a BM for the past ___ days. Pt also reports of a cough for the past few months.       Past Medical History: -Remote stroke ___ with left eye deficit and was told of a third left cranial nerve defect. She states she had extensive  neurologic examination with no clear origin to her stroke. She  was treated with heparin in the acute period -CVA ___ - paroxysmal afib previously treated with Plavix and ASA, then  ASA alone and not just coumadin - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia - lumbar stenosis - retinal hemorrhages in ___ R>L with residual partial R eye blindness. unknown etiology  Surgical Hx:  - Surgery for left breast cancer in situ ___ - Breast reconstruction in ___ - Appendectomy - Tonsillectomy - Adenoidectomy - bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ___ - A facelift in ___    Social History: ___ Family History: -mother: MI, stroke, lymphoma  -father: HTN

Thought: This patient presents with signs and symptoms concerning for acute cholecystitis. Given her history of remote stroke, afib, and current anticoagulation status, it's important to assess her coagulation profile and determine the best approach for managing her cholecystitis.  Additionally, her constipation and cough warrant further investigation.  I also need her age and the duration of constipation to better assess her current condition.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show leukocytosis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, hypokalemia, and a significantly elevated INR.  The elevated white blood cell count supports the diagnosis of cholecystitis. The anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypokalemia could be caused by a variety of factors and require further investigation.  The elevated INR is likely due to her coumadin use and needs to be addressed before any surgical intervention. I still need the patient's age and the duration of her constipation, as well as the amylase and stool guaiac results.  A physical exam, specifically of the abdomen and lungs, would also be beneficial.

Thought: This 85-year-old female presents with acute cholecystitis, evidenced by RUQ pain, fever, and leukocytosis.  Her imaging findings of a thickened gallbladder wall and pericholecystic fluid further support this diagnosis.  She also has significant comorbidities, including a history of stroke, atrial fibrillation, and is currently anticoagulated.  Her elevated INR (3.0) poses a risk for bleeding and needs to be addressed prior to any surgical intervention.  The anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypokalemia are concerning and warrant further investigation.  Her constipation and chronic cough also need to be addressed.  The physical exam confirms RUQ tenderness and a positive Murphy's sign, consistent with cholecystitis.  The lack of rebound or guarding suggests that the inflammation is likely localized.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation, which lessens the concern for pneumonia, but the chronic cough still needs to be evaluated.  Her mental status is intact.
