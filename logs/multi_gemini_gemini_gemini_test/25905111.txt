Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ man with history significant for  laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy by Dr. ___ in ___,  nephrolithiasis and HTN, who started having epigastric abdominal  pain that awoke him from sleep around 3 AM today.   The pain was severe, crampy in nature, radiated to his back, and  has not ceased since then (however has improved from ___ to  ___ after morphine).  Pain not /w n/v, pre-syncope, or dyspnea.  Denies episodes of pain with exertion.  Had episode of crampy  epigastric pain after fatty meal that lasted only 1.5 hrs, not  severe in nature, about 1 week prior. He had tacos (steak/pork)  and pizza 10pm last night. Last BM last evening without blood  and has regular bowel habits. He works in a ___ shop. Has had  a prior RUQUS ___ without stones, but none since. No h/o prior  EGD either. Has had episodes of bleeding per rectum (bright red)  rarely, last was ~1 mo prior. Had ~80 lb wt loss after the  surgery, now back up to 228 lbs from preop wt 280 lbs. He does  not drink regularly, last ETOH was last week 1 beer, and does  not ever consume ETOH in large amounts.  Is a nonsmoker.  Denies  NSAID use.  Started taking an herbal supplement to curb appetite  last week and is not sure what herbs or vitamins are in it.  He  ordered this online.  Exercises regularly (walks several miles  2x/week) and tries to eat healthy foods. At time of initial  consultation no LFTs nor lipase were available and no ultrasound  had been ordered, but at time of current note lipase is notably  in excess of 9000 and ultrasound is notable for cholelithiasis  without  cholecystitis.  Surgery is now consulted for evaluation  and management.      Past Medical History: - Sleep apnea - Plantar fasciitis - Left Achilles tendon tear - Gout                                                             - H/o heartburn - H/o nephrolithiasis - H/o diverticulitis          PSH:  - *S/P lap sleeve gastrectomy ___ (___) preop wt 280 lbs now ___ lbs had been as low as 200 lbs ___    Social History: ___ Family History: - Father h/o HTN and stroke - Mother - living                                                - Brother - healthy


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of sleeve gastrectomy, acute severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, elevated lipase, and cholelithiasis on ultrasound, the most likely diagnosis is gallstone pancreatitis. However, given the history of recent herbal supplement use, it's important to rule out other potential causes of pancreatitis, such as drug-induced pancreatitis. Additionally, his history of intermittent rectal bleeding warrants further investigation.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has signs, symptoms, and laboratory results consistent with gallstone pancreatitis.  The elevated lipase, ALT, AST, along with the presence of gallstones on ultrasound support this diagnosis. While the patient started a new herbal supplement recently, the timeline and clinical picture strongly suggest gallstone pancreatitis as the primary cause. The low calcium should be monitored and corrected if necessary.  The history of rectal bleeding is unrelated to the acute issue and can be addressed later. I will recommend a surgical consult for evaluation and management of gallstone pancreatitis.
