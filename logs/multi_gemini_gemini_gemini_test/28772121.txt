HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ yo F with h/o obesity, with one day history of n/v and  abdominal pain.  Pt had sushi for lunch on ___, then chicken &  noodles for dinner, with a single drink.  She had gradual onset  of epigastric pain, accompanied by nausea and three episodes of  nonbloody emesis. She saw her PCP yesterday, who began  procholoperazine and prilosec for possible gastritis, which  provided only some relief.  The PCP checked her amylase (3446)  and lipase (2816); the covering PCP referred the pt to the ED  for further evaluation, but she felt drowsy from the antiemetic,  so elected to wait until this am to present to the ED.  In the ED, lipase was 767.  RUQ US revealed a thin gallbladder  filled with gallstones.  There is shadowing in the CBD c/w  gallstone; CBD is focally dilated to 9 mm.  There is no  pericholecystic fluid.  The ED contacted the ERCP team, who recommended admission to the  medical service for further care.  Now feels ok with only minimal left-sided abdominal pain; no  radiation.  No current n/v.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a history highly suggestive of acute gallstone pancreatitis, with supporting evidence including elevated amylase and lipase, and gallstones with CBD dilation and shadowing on ultrasound. While the initial lipase was markedly elevated, the downtrending lipase in the ED suggests resolving pancreatitis.  Given the presence of choledocholithiasis, it's crucial to assess liver function and rule out other potential complications.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results confirm the diagnosis of acute gallstone pancreatitis with choledocholithiasis. The elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase) and mildly elevated bilirubin suggest some degree of biliary obstruction.  The elevated INR, while not drastically high, warrants attention and suggests potential early hepatic dysfunction. The leukocytosis is consistent with the inflammatory process of pancreatitis.  The patient's symptoms are improving, and the decreasing lipase suggests resolving pancreatitis.  Given the choledocholithiasis and evidence of biliary obstruction, ERCP is indicated to remove the stone and decompress the biliary system.
