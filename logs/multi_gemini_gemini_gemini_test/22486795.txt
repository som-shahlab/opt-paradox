HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ PMH signigicant for CLL, CAD s/p stent, and metastatic melanoma presents with RUQ pain. Denies nausea/vomiting. +fever currently in the ED. No changes in bowels, last BM yesterday and continues to pass flatus.   Of note, he was admitted on ___ with painless jaundice and underwent an ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement for  CBD obstruction. He was noted to have choledocholithiasis at that time. He denies any history of biliary colic. His jaundice has completely resolved in the interim, and his LFTs have  normalized.    Past Medical History: Metastatic melanoma as below. -s/p Excision of melanoma, L shoulder ___. -CLL/SLL, diagnosed ___ on cervical lymph node biopsy. Bone marrow biopsy on ___ was normal aside from 6 lymphoid aggregates c/w CLL/SLL. Treated with rituximab in ___. -CAD s/p stent ___. -herniated disc s/p surgery ___. -s/p R and L knee replacement -BPH  Oncologic hx:  Diagnosed with melanoma of the left shoulder and underwent excision (stage IB, ___ level IV) in ___. In ___, he developed an episode of word finding difficulty that lasted for a few minutes. MRI Head was done on ___ and showed a left frontal mass. CT Chest was subsequently performed and showed 4 lung nodules, the largest measuring 2.3 cm. CT Abdomen showed borderline splenomegaly and no evidence of metastatic disease. A follow-up MRI Head on ___ showed a 3.4 x 3.9 x  2.7 cm heterogeneously enhancing, necrotic mass in the left inferior frontal lobe region of Broca's area. Dr. ___ left frontal craniotomy and resection of the mass at ___ on  ___, with pathology confirming metastatic melanoma (positive for MART-1, S-100, and HMB-45). The specimen showed a BRAF V600 mutation by PCR.   Post-resection MRIs on ___ and ___ revealed peripheral enhancement along the resection cavity. On ___, he underwent Gamma Knife radiosurgery to the tumor resection cavity. The MRI done for the Gamma Knife also showed a second small metastasis  in the left parietal lobe, adjacent to the sagittal sinus, and this second lesion was also treated with Gamma Knife. Both lesions were treated to 20 Gy.  He continued his care with Dr. ___ at ___ and also met with Dr. ___ at ___ on ___ for a second  opinion. He was recommended combination BRAF/MEK inhibition with dabrafenib and trametinib and started the medications in  ___. He continued to have surveillance imaging. CT Torso on ___ showed overall stability of 7 pulmonary nodules, the largest measuring 1.6 cm. There were also multiple small mediastinal lymph nodes stable in size. However, CT Head on ___ showed  an enlarging lesion in the left parietal lobe from 0.8 cm to 2 cm. MRI Brain was done on the same date and showed significant enlargement of the left parietal lobe mass that was previously treated with Gamma Knife, with surrounding vasogenic edema.  He underwent craniotomy and resection of the left parietal mass on ___ with Dr. ___ at ___. He did well ___. Post-operative MRI showed gross total  resection of the mass lesion without other new lesions. However, invasion of the dura was seen. Pathology was consistent with metastatic melanoma, BRAF V600 mutated. His case was discussed at the ___ Neuro-oncology Tumor Board. Given prior Gamma Knife to the lesion, it was demed a Gamma Knife failure and there is no plan for additional Gamma Knife. Whole brain radiotherapy was discussed, but given the patient's age, it was felt not to be a good option given the potential toxicities.  He continued on dabrafenib and trametinib and had periodic restaging CT and MRI. His most recent MRI Head on ___ showed  a 1.4 x 1.1 x 1.3 cm masslike enhancement within the left parietal lobe adjacent to the prior resection bed. CT Torso on the same date showed several stable left lung nodules and no other areas concerning for metastatic disease. Per patient report, he was noted to have incidental finding of intestinalis pneumonitis  that has been present for the past year for which Dr. ___ is considering further workup. He was evaluated again at ___ Neurosurgery with plan for Gamma Knife. Repeat scan identified  an additional smaller lesion anteriorly involving the falx. He received Gamma Knife 20 cGy to each of the 2 lesions on ___.  He continued on dabrafenib and trametinib with repeat brain imaging showing 7 new punctate lesions. He underwent Gamma Knife again to these lesions in ___.  PET scan on ___ continued to show stable disease.    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother - died of breast cancer.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and elevated bilirubin.  The leukocytosis could be related to infection or his underlying CLL.  Thrombocytosis is also consistent with his CLL. The elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin suggest biliary obstruction. Given his recent ERCP, history of choledocholithiasis, fever, and RUQ pain, concern for cholangitis remains high. Imaging is needed to evaluate the biliary tree. Blood cultures are pending.
Action: imaging
Action Input: RUQ ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound):  EXAMINATION: LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  TECHNIQUE: Grey scale and color Doppler ultrasound images of the abdomen were obtained.  FINDINGS: Exam limited by poor penetration of deeper structures.  LIVER: The hepatic parenchyma appears within normal limits. The contour of the liver is smooth. There is no focal liver mass noting that not all portions of the liver well assessed. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. A tiny amount of ascites is seen in the right upper quadrant.  BILE DUCTS: There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. The CHD measures 2 mm.  GALLBLADDER: The gallbladder is distended but there is no evidence of stones or gallbladder wall thickening. Biliary sludge is noted near the gallbladder neck.  PANCREAS: The pancreas is not well visualized, largely obscured by overlying bowel gas.  SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 14.0 cm."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The ultrasound shows a normal common hepatic duct and no intrahepatic biliary dilation.  The gallbladder is distended with sludge but no stones. The pancreas is not well visualized.  Given the patient's persistent RUQ pain, fever, elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, and history of choledocholithiasis and recent ERCP, there is still concern for possible stent occlusion or another etiology for biliary obstruction.  An MRCP would be helpful to further evaluate the biliary tree and pancreas. Blood cultures are still pending.
Action: imaging
Action Input: MRCP

ToolMessage:
"The requested MRCP is not available among the provided imaging studies. The only available studies are a chest X-ray (PA & LAT) and a liver/gallbladder ultrasound."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The ultrasound shows a normal common hepatic duct and no intrahepatic biliary dilation.  The gallbladder is distended with sludge but no stones. The pancreas is not well visualized. Given the patient's persistent RUQ pain, fever, elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, and history of choledocholithiasis and recent ERCP, there is still concern for possible stent occlusion or another etiology for biliary obstruction. While an MRCP would be ideal, it is not available.  The patient's presentation is concerning for cholangitis.  Will proceed with treatment for presumed cholangitis while awaiting blood culture results.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain, fever, elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis. He has a history of CLL, choledocholithiasis, and a recent ERCP with sphincterotomy and stent placement.  The ultrasound showed no intrahepatic biliary dilation and a normal common hepatic duct. The gallbladder was distended with sludge but no stones. The pancreas was not well visualized. While an MRCP would be ideal, it is not available.
