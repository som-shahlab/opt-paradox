Thought: Patient with history of cirrhosis, HCC s/p treatment, presenting with RUQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. Physical exam reveals distended abdomen with tenderness to RUQ, but no rebound or guarding. Labs show elevated lipase, suggestive of pancreatitis, but RUQ US did not show biliary dilation.  Elevated bilirubin, INR, and AFP, along with the patient's history of HCC, raise strong suspicion for HCC recurrence or progression.  While the elevated lipase could indicate pancreatitis, the overall clinical picture points towards HCC as the primary concern.  A CT abdomen would be helpful to evaluate the liver and surrounding structures for evidence of HCC recurrence/progression, as well as to assess for other potential causes of abdominal pain such as ascites or bowel obstruction.

Thought: Patient with history of cirrhosis, HCC s/p treatment, presenting with RUQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal distension. Physical exam reveals distended abdomen with tenderness to RUQ, but no rebound or guarding. Labs show elevated lipase, suggestive of pancreatitis, but RUQ US did not show biliary dilation. Elevated bilirubin, INR, and AFP, along with the patient's history of HCC, raise strong suspicion for HCC recurrence or progression.  The lack of biliary dilation on ultrasound makes pancreatitis less likely. Given the patient's complex history and current presentation, an MRCP was performed.  I will review the MRCP report to further evaluate the biliary tree and assess for other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.  If the MRCP does not provide a clear diagnosis, a CT abdomen with contrast will be necessary.
Action: imaging
Action Input: MRCP report

ToolMessage:
"Here is the MRCP report from the available imaging studies:  MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC):  EXAMINATION: MRCP:  TECHNIQUE: T1- and T2-weighted multiplanar images of the abdomen were acquired in a 1.5 T magnet. Intravenous contrast: 9 mL Gadavist. Oral contrast: 1 cc of Gadavist mixed with 50 cc of water was administered for oral contrast.  FINDINGS: Lower Thorax: Small bilateral effusions noted.  MRCP: The liver has a nodular contour, consistent with cirrhosis. Trace ascites is similar to the prior examination. In hepatic segment 8, the previously seen nodule showing arterial hyper enhancement and washout, measuring 1.7 cm AP x 1.7 cm transverse, with a pseudo capsule, consistent with hepato cellular carcinoma(0PTN-5a), is again increased in size having previously measured 8 mm.  There is been prior CyberKnife treatment in hepatic segments 4A and 8. As before, a zone of fibrosis, of low signal intensity on precontrast T1 weighted images with progressive enhancement, is re- demonstrated in this region. Segmental intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation in segment 4A and 2 is perhaps slightly increased. On prior MRI, interspersed patchy arterial hyper enhancement throughout this region was suspicious for multifocal HCC, and on today's study there has been progression of regional arterial phase hyper enhancement now with discrete areas of washout (13 04:31, approximately 1.6 x 1.6 cm, 13 03:39, 1.6 x 1.4 cm, are representative), and diffusely throughout hepatic segment 2), with overall enlargement of the left lobe, consistent with multifocal/infiltrative involvement by ___.  Bland thrombosis of main trunk of the left portal vein is unchanged, but an oblong configuration of a mass showing washout is worrisome for tumor thrombus invading the distal portion of the left portal vein (13 04:32). Post ablation changes are seen in hepatic segment 6, without evidence for residual disease. Area of wedge shaped hyperenhancement in hepatic segment VII, at the site of a previously seen focus of discrete enhancement, has enlarged compared to prior study, but does not show washout or discrete correlate on other sequences, and may be perfusional. Postradiation changes are seen in hepatic segment 4A and 8, as on prior examinations, with biliary ductal dilatation, which is unchanged. No stones are seen in the common bile duct. Linear filling defect in the distal common bile duct is likely artifactual. The gallbladder is surgically absent.  Pancreas: The pancreas demonstrates normal signal and enhancement Spleen: The spleen is enlarged, measuring 16 cm, similar to the prior examination. Adrenal Glands: The adrenals are normal in appearance, without evidence for mass or enlargement. Kidneys: Bilateral renal cysts are unchanged from the prior examination, measuring up to 4.4 cm on the left and 3.4 cm on the right. No hydronephrosis or concerning renal lesions. Gastrointestinal Tract: Bowel containing periumbilical hernia again noted. Lymph Nodes: No adenopathy by size criteria. Vasculature: Thrombosed left portal vein again noted. Osseous and Soft Tissue Structures: No concerning osseous or soft tissue lesions.  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with ___ , M.D. by ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:25 AM, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings."

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) progression with portal vein thrombosis
