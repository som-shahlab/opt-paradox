HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w h/o CAD p/w RLQ abdominal pain and nausea. Pt states he  had acute moderately-severe RLQ pain 5 days ago. The pain then  went away except for a very slight discomfort until last night,  when the pain became much more severe. Pt has never had pain  like this before. It has not migrated and does not radiate. Pt  reports subjective low grade fevers and mild nausea. Denies  emesis and anorexia. Last BM was this (now yesterday) afternoon  and was normal. Pt did have some constipation yesterday. No  diarrhea. Last ate at 4pm. Pt stopped taking plavix in early ___. Last colonoscopy  ___, 1 small benign polyp removed.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: CAD w h/o IMI ___ s/p DES x2, negative ETT in ___ HTN IBS Nocturia Hemorrhoids  Past Surgical History: T&A    Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. The pain initially resolved but recurred with increased severity.  Given the location and presentation, appendicitis is high on the differential. Other possibilities include diverticulitis, mesenteric adenitis, or other inflammatory processes. A physical exam is needed to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on RLQ tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, McBurney's point tenderness, Obturator sign, Psoas sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure

ToolMessage:
"Vitals: 97.2 75 127/89 18 100%RA  GEN: A&O, NAD, well appearing HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR PULM: No respiratory distress ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender to RLQ palpation at ___ point and inferolateral to it, no rebound or guarding, negative obturator & psoas signs Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ abdominal pain, nausea, and subjective fevers. The initial improvement followed by worsening pain, along with RLQ tenderness on exam, points towards appendicitis.  While the absence of rebound tenderness and guarding lowers the likelihood, it doesn't rule it out.  Given the patient's history of CAD and prior use of Plavix, it's important to consider other diagnoses like diverticulitis or mesenteric adenitis.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast would help visualize the appendix and surrounding structures to confirm or rule out appendicitis and evaluate for other potential causes of the pain.  Lab tests are also needed to assess for signs of infection and inflammation.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, CRP, urinalysis

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and elevated white blood cell count suggest appendicitis.  The urinalysis is normal, making a urinary tract infection less likely.  While the CRP is not available, the other lab results don't indicate other obvious diagnoses.  A CT scan is necessary to visualize the appendix and confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis after administration of 150cc intravenous contrast. Axial images were interpreted in conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats. DLP: 952 mGy-cm CTDIvol: 16 mGy  FINDINGS:  CHEST: The imaged lung bases are clear. Tiny calcified granulomas are noted at the lung bases bilaterally. There is no pleural effusion. The heart is normal in size with no pericardial effusion. Moderate calcification of the right coronary artery is noted.  ABDOMEN: In the right lower quadrant and there is a dilated appendix which is hyperemic and demonstrates significant surrounding stranding. The appendix measures up to 1.3 cm. There is no adjacent abscess, however there is significant phlegmonous change. No free air or free fluid is seen.  The liver is normal in attenuation with no focal lesions. The gallbladder is decompressed with no radiopaque stones. There is suggestion of fundal adenomyomatosis. The pancreas is mildly atrophic but otherwise unremarkable. The spleen is normal in size and attenuation. The adrenal glands are normal bilaterally. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically. Cortical hypodensities at the upper pole of the left kidney likely represent cysts, however too small to characterize.  The small bowel is normal in caliber with no evidence of obstruction. There is thickening at the base of the cecum as a result of the adjacent inflammatory process. The remainder of the large bowel is normal.  PELVIS: Urinary bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles are normal. There is no pelvic free fluid or lymphadenopathy.  VESSELS: The aorta is normal in caliber and its major branches are patent.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion concerning for malignancy."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam, elevated white blood cell count, and the CT scan findings of a dilated, hyperemic appendix with surrounding stranding and phlegmonous change confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The patient requires an appendectomy.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, and subjective fevers, combined with the physical exam findings of RLQ tenderness, elevated WBC, and the CT findings of a dilated, hyperemic appendix with surrounding stranding and phlegmonous change, confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Diverticulitis
4. Epiploic Appendagitis
5. Cecal Volvulus

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment.  Given the patient's history of CAD and prior Plavix use, a surgical consult should be obtained to discuss the optimal surgical approach (laparoscopic vs. open) and perioperative management of his cardiovascular risk factors.  The patient should be made NPO and started on IV fluids, antibiotics with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage (e.g., cefoxitin or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole), and pain control.
