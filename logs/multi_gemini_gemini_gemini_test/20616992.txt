He woke up early this AM with what he  felt was "gas pain" through out his abd. He experienced a lot of  belching and thought this may go away with a bowel movement. He  had a normal BM and the pain persisted. The pain waxed and waned  but never decreased past a baseline of about ___ (peak ___.  Prior to presenting the ED the pain was diffuse through his  whole abdomen. Unlike his previous angina, which was more  scapular pain. He reports nausea but denies vomiting,  fevers/chills, diarrhea, constipation, hematochezia, melena,  reflux, chest pain, SOB, dysuria.  .

Social History: ___ Family History: Father deceased at age ___, sudden death. A paternal uncle had lung cancer.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right-sided abdominal pain with a history of significant cardiac disease.  The changing location and character of the pain, along with the improvement after morphine, makes the diagnosis unclear. It could be biliary colic, but given the cardiac history, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) must be ruled out. Other possibilities include peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, or even musculoskeletal pain.  I need more information to narrow down the differential diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The lab results are largely unremarkable, with normal liver function tests, lipase, and troponin. This makes biliary pathology and acute coronary syndrome less likely. The slightly elevated white blood cell count is non-specific and could be due to stress or other causes.  The patient's history of PUD, the initial diffuse abdominal pain followed by localization to the RUQ, and the lack of other positive findings suggest a possible peptic ulcer exacerbation or gastritis. An abdominal ultrasound would be helpful to evaluate for other potential causes of abdominal pain, such as gallstones, cholecystitis, or appendicitis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"Here is the requested abdominal ultrasound report (listed as LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US):  TECHNIQUE: Grayscale and color ultrasound images of the liver and gallbladder were obtained.  FINDINGS: There are no focal hepatic lesions. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation with the common bile duct measuring 4 mm. There are mobile, shadowing stones in the gallbladder but no evidence of wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder distention. The partially visualized pancreas is normal. The spleen is normal in size measuring 11 cm. There is no upper quadrant ascites. Portal vein is patent with normal hepatopetal flow."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with right-sided abdominal pain.  His history of CAD and prior NSTEMI made ACS a key differential to rule out.  His pain initially improved with morphine and localized to the RUQ.  Labs were obtained and were only remarkable for a mildly elevated WBC.  Troponin was negative.  Abdominal ultrasound showed gallstones without signs of cholecystitis. Given the negative troponin, normal LFTs/lipase, and the presence of gallstones, the most likely diagnosis is biliary colic.
Action: done
Action Input: ""
