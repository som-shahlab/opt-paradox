HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This is a ___ year old otherwise healthy female presents with 12 hours of abdominal pain. She states that it started as a periumbilical pain around 9 am this morning and then moved to ___. She had some associated nausea but no vomiting. She  endorses subjective chills but no fever.  She denies any family or personal history of IBD. She was anemic back in ___ most probably from menstrual bleeding and was  worked up in ___ and EGD/colonoscopy were negative.    Past Medical History:  PMH: menstrual bleeding, anemia, uterine polyp,    PSH: c section x2, EGD/colonoscopy for anemia-both negative, colonic polyp removal- benign    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: I need more information about the patient's age, the location of the abdominal pain, and when she was worked up for anemia to understand the current situation better.  Knowing the specific location of the pain is crucial for differential diagnosis. The timing of the anemia workup helps determine the relevance of those findings to the current presentation.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation), McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign

ToolMessage:
"Exam on admission: GEN: A&Ox3, appears anxious HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR,  PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No labored breathing ABD: Soft, nondistended, TTP at RLQ with +rebound, no guarding  or diffuse peritoneal signs, -Rovsing Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused  Exam"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, along with tenderness at McBurney's point and rebound tenderness, strongly suggests appendicitis.  The absence of guarding or diffuse peritoneal signs could indicate early appendicitis.  While the previous negative EGD/colonoscopy makes IBD less likely, it doesn't rule it out entirely.  Given the strong suspicion for appendicitis, I would proceed with imaging to confirm the diagnosis before considering other less likely diagnoses.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast study that matches your request. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 0.5 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 2.4 mGy (Body) DLP = 1.2 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 4.5 s, 49.0 cm; CTDIvol = 7.0 mGy (Body) DLP = 343.3 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 344 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Other than mild right basilar atelectasis, the partially imaged lower lungs are clear. No evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: Sub-centimeter hypodensities in segment 4a and segment 6 of the liver are too small to accurately characterize but could be cysts or biliary hamartomas (series 2, image 26, 23). The liver parenchyma otherwise demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. No evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. No peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrograms. No evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. No perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: Oral contrast reaches the proximal ascending colon. The stomach is markedly distended with ingested contrast. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The appendix is dilated up to 11 mm with wall thickening and mild hyperemia (series 6018, image 22). There is surrounding mild to moderate fat stranding and trace free fluid along the right pericolic gutter. The adjacent wall of the cecum is slightly edematous, likely reactive. A few scattered mesenteric lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant are also likely reactive. No drainable fluid collection or evidence of perforation. Within the lumen of the fluid-filled dilated appendix there are some small hyperdense, round foci, including at the base of the cecum which likely represent obstructing appendicoliths (series 6018, image 24, 25). The colon is otherwise within normal limits. The rectum is within normal limits. No bowel obstruction or pneumatosis.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is trace free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Several subcentimeter hypodense lesions within the uterus are most likely fibroids (series 6018, image ___, ___, 25). The adnexa are within normal limits. Pelvic varices and prominent bilateral gonadal veins, left greater than right, are noted.  LYMPH NODES: Right lower quadrant mesenteric nodes are likely reactive. No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: No abdominal aortic aneurysm. No calcified atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: No evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 8:45 ___, 10 minutes after discovery of the findings."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's history, physical exam findings, and the CT scan confirming an inflamed appendix with appendicoliths strongly support the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The CT findings of a dilated appendix with wall thickening, periappendiceal fat stranding, and appendicoliths are highly specific for appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of migrating periumbilical pain to the RLQ, combined with RLQ tenderness, rebound tenderness, and the CT findings of a dilated appendix with wall thickening, periappendiceal fat stranding, and possible appendicolith, confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric adenitis
3. Ovarian cyst or torsion (less likely given normal adnexa on CT)
4. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (less likely given lack of fever and other risk factors)
5. Gastroenteritis (less likely given localized findings and lack of vomiting/diarrhea)

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment. This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the severity of the inflammation and surgeon preference.  Pre-operative antibiotics should be administered to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole).  Post-operative care includes pain management, monitoring for complications (e.g., infection, abscess), and early ambulation.  The patient should be advised to follow a clear liquid diet initially and gradually advance to a regular diet as tolerated.
