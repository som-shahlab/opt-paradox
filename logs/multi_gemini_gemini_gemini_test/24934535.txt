HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
The patient is a ___ w/ h/o GERD, IBS who presents to the ED  with 1 day of epigastrium abdominal pain associated with fevers,  general malaise, and leukocytosis and now seen in consultation  by ___ for further evaluation. The patient states, he woke up yesterday morning with fever and  general malaise associated with abdominal pain located to his  epigastrium and periumbilical area. He describes this pain as  crampy in nature, waxing and waning and he does not recall any  aggravating or alleviating factors. He comes to the ED for further evaluation. Upon arrival to the ED, 97, 91, 131/104, 16,  97% RA. Labs remarkable for leukocytosis to 16.000 and RUQ U/S with findings  of gallstone, with no signs of acute cholecystitis.     Past Medical History: Past Medical History: GERD, IBD  Past Surgical History: remote open appendectomy     Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric and periumbilical pain, fever, malaise, and leukocytosis. The differential diagnosis includes acute cholecystitis, although the initial ultrasound does not show signs of it, pancreatitis, appendicitis (although the patient had an appendectomy), peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, and other intra-abdominal infections.  Given the patient's history of GERD and IBD, these also need to be considered.  I need more information to narrow down the diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lipase is normal, making pancreatitis less likely.  The CMP, urinalysis, and other available labs are also unremarkable.  While the ultrasound showed gallstones, there were no signs of acute cholecystitis. The patient still has fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis.  An abdominal CT scan would be helpful to evaluate for other causes of abdominal pain and identify any potential sources of infection.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST report:  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. IV Contrast: 130 mL Omnipaque. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Acquisition sequence: 1) CT Localizer Radiograph 2) CT Localizer Radiograph 3) Stationary Acquisition 5.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 24.1 mGy (Body) DLP = 12.0 mGy-cm. 4) Spiral Acquisition 5.1 s, 56.0 cm; CTDIvol = 16.8 mGy (Body) DLP = 942.2 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 954 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: LOWER CHEST: There is linear atelectasis at the right lung base. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is a subcentimeter hypodensity in the left lobe of the liver which is too small to characterize (series 2, image 21). There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder demonstrates a calcified stone in the region of the neck (series 2, image 25). There is no CT evidence of acute cholecystitis.  PANCREAS: There is mild fatty atrophy of the head of the pancreas. There are no focal pancreatic lesions. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. There are accessory spleens present near the left hemidiaphragm (series 2, image 17).  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The distal esophagus is normal without a hiatal hernia. The stomach is relatively decompressed and unremarkable. Arising from a distal loop of jejunum is a 2.9 x 3.8 cm (AP by transverse) thick-walled structure with an air-fluid level and extensive surrounding fat stranding (series 601b, image 18; series 602b, image 45). This region corresponds to a loop of bowel of small bowel which demonstrated a large diverticula on the CT scan from ___ (series 9, image 62 on the prior CT scan). The small bowel is otherwise unremarkable. The large bowel is normal in caliber without focal wall thickening. The appendix is not visualized but there are no secondary signs of appendicitis in the right lower quadrant. There is no intra-abdominal free air.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate is unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal adenopathy. There are multiple mildly enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes in the region of inflammation measuring up to 12 mm (series 2, image 54), likely reactive. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. A sclerotic focus in the T12 vertebral body is unchanged from ___ and most consistent with a bone island.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan reveals a thick-walled structure with an air-fluid level in the distal jejunum with surrounding fat stranding. This finding, combined with the patient's symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, and leukocytosis, strongly suggests jejunal diverticulitis with inflammation.  The report also mentions a prior CT scan showing a large diverticulum in this location, further supporting this diagnosis. Other potential diagnoses have been ruled out by the negative findings on the CT scan and lab results.
