HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ healthy female who presents with abdominal pain which started four days ago. She states that immediately after eating fried rice on ___ evening, she developed epigastric and RUQ pain radiating to the back associated with nausea and  non-bilious emesis. It lasted several hours without alleviating or exacerbating factors and then resolved. The pain returned yesterday, awaking her from sleep at 4 am, but this time it was located all over her abdomen, not simply in the epigastrium or RUQ. She denies fevers or chills, is moving her bowels normally, is not on her period or sexually active and denies burning on urination. Currently she notes that her pain is persistent, but localized to her RUQ and also her hypogastrium.    Past Medical History: PMH: UTI many years ago  PSH: No prior operations  Allergies: None    Social History: ___ Family History: No family history of gallbladder disease


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's recurrent abdominal pain, initially localized to the epigastric and RUQ region and radiating to the back, followed by diffuse abdominal pain and now localized to the RUQ and hypogastrium, raises suspicion for several diagnoses, including biliary colic, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or appendicitis.  Given the initial symptoms and their recurrence, it's crucial to investigate these possibilities further.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs are notable for a leukocytosis with neutrophilia.  Her lipase is normal, and her liver function tests and bilirubin are normal.  Amylase was not obtained.  An ultrasound is needed to assess for biliary disease.
Action: imaging
Action Input: RUQ ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN):  TECHNIQUE: Grey scale and color Doppler ultrasound images of the abdomen were obtained.  FINDINGS:  LIVER: The hepatic parenchyma appears within normal limits. The contour of the liver is smooth. There is no focal liver mass. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is no ascites.  BILE DUCTS: There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. The CBD measures 4 mm.  GALLBLADDER: There is diffuse gallbladder wall thickening, nonspecific. Ring-down artifact is demonstrated at the neck, which suggests at least some component of adenomyomatosis. The gallbladder itself is not distended. There is no pericholecystic fluid. Negative sonographic ___ sign on exam. Non shadowing sludge is seen at the fundus.  PANCREAS: Imaged portion of the pancreas appears within normal limits, without masses or pancreatic ductal dilation, with portions of the pancreatic tail obscured by overlying bowel gas.  RETROPERITONEUM: Visualized portions of aorta and IVC are within normal limits.  NOTIFICATION: Findings discussed in person with Dr. ___."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with recurrent RUQ pain radiating to the back, initially associated with nausea and vomiting.  Her labs show leukocytosis.  RUQ ultrasound shows diffuse gallbladder wall thickening and ring-down artifact at the neck suggesting adenomyomatosis, but no stones or pericholecystic fluid.  The negative sonographic Murphy's sign argues against acute cholecystitis. While adenomyomatosis can cause symptoms, the patient's presentation is more consistent with biliary colic.  Given the sludge seen within the gallbladder, it is possible she passed a gallstone which caused transient cystic duct obstruction and her initial symptoms.  The current symptoms may be related to gallbladder dysmotility or could represent a separate process.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with recurrent RUQ pain radiating to the back, initially associated with nausea and vomiting.  Her labs show leukocytosis with neutrophilia.  RUQ ultrasound demonstrates gallbladder wall thickening and sludge without stones or pericholecystic fluid.  The most likely diagnosis is acalculous cholecystitis given the clinical picture and imaging findings.  Adenomyomatosis is also noted, but this is an incidental finding and not likely the cause of her symptoms.  While choledocholithiasis is possible, the normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase make this less likely.  Appendicitis is less likely given the localization of pain to the RUQ and hypogastrium and the lack of fever.  Pancreatitis is also less likely given the normal lipase.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acalculous cholecystitis
2. Choledocholithiasis
3. Appendicitis
4. Pancreatitis
5. Adenomyomatosis

Treatment: Admit the patient for IV fluids, pain control, and NPO status.  Obtain a surgical consultation for possible cholecystectomy.  If the patient continues to have pain or develops fever, proceed with cholecystectomy.  If there is concern for choledocholithiasis, an MRCP or ERCP may be necessary prior to cholecystectomy.  Continue to monitor labs and clinical status.
