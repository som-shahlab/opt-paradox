HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old otherwise healthy woman who presents with periumbilical -> RLQ pain. The patient was in her usual state of health until 10pm the night prior to presentation when she developed worsening periumbilical pain. She developed worsening nausea and NBNB vomiting. She presented to the ED for further evaluation. On ED presentation, she noted RLQ > periumbilical pain. She continued to have nausea but denied fevers, chills, diarrhea, sweats, recent weight loss, BRBPR, melena, chest pain, and SOB. Her last meal was the prior evening and her last drink of water was 5am the morning of presentation.    Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of migrating periumbilical pain to RLQ pain, nausea, and vomiting raises suspicion for acute appendicitis.  To assess this further, I need vital signs,  a physical exam focusing on the abdomen, and laboratory tests.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: vital signs, abdominal tenderness to palpation (including McBurney's point, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign),  assess for rebound tenderness and guarding

ToolMessage:
"Exam on Admission Vitals: T 98.7 HR 76 BP 126/64 RR19 SpO2 100%RA GEN: A&O, lethargic but easily arousable, resting in stretcher HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes dry CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended. Tenderness to palpation in RLQ >periumbilical. No rebound or guarding. Negative ___ sign. No palpable masses. Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused.  Exam"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation is highly suspicious for acute appendicitis given the migrating pain, nausea, vomiting, and RLQ tenderness.  The absence of rebound tenderness and guarding does not rule out appendicitis.  Laboratory tests are needed to assess for leukocytosis and other signs of inflammation.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, urinalysis

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including migrating periumbilical pain to RLQ, nausea, vomiting,  leukocytosis (WBC 17.1), and neutrophilia (90.2%) strongly suggests acute appendicitis.  The slightly elevated glucose may be due to stress response.  While the urinalysis shows some WBCs and RBCs, it's not indicative of a urinary tract infection given the lack of nitrites and other symptoms. An abdominal CT scan would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain. However, given the classic presentation and lab findings, I'm confident in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
