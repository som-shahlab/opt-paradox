InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right flank/RLQ pain, history of microhematuria/recurrent UTIs, and chronic back pain. The current pain is crampy and spasmodic, which could suggest a renal or ureteral stone. Her history of hematuria and UTIs further supports this possibility. However, the initial CT scan was negative for nephrolithiasis.  Given the negative initial CT and lack of current urinary symptoms, other diagnoses like appendicitis, ovarian cyst, or musculoskeletal pain should also be considered.  I need more information to narrow down the diagnosis.
Action: imaging

Thought: The patient presents with right flank/RLQ pain, history of microhematuria/recurrent UTIs, and chronic back pain. The current pain is crampy and spasmodic, which could suggest a renal or ureteral stone. Her history of hematuria and UTIs further supports this possibility. The initial CT scan was negative for nephrolithiasis, but a CT urogram may be more sensitive for detecting small stones or ureteral obstruction.  Given the persistent pain and the possibility of a missed stone, I will order a CT urogram. Other diagnoses like appendicitis, ovarian cyst, or musculoskeletal pain should also be considered if the CT urogram is negative. I also need to know the current pain level and more details about the prior cystoscopy and cytology results to better understand her history of hematuria.

Action Input: CT urogram of the abdomen and pelvis

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT urogram (CTU) of the abdomen and pelvis in the available studies. Here is the complete report:  CTU (ABD/PEL) W/&W/O CONTRAST (CTU):  EXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN PELVIS WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST.  TECHNIQUE: CTU: Multidetector CT of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired prior to and after intravenous contrast administration with the patient in prone position. The non-contrast scan was done with low radiation dose technique. The contrast scan was performed with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was notadministered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: DLP: 1266.51 mgy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: A right lung base pulmonary cyst is unchanged compared to the prior study. Otherwise, the visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN:  HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. The previously described hydroureteronephrosis on the left has resolved. There is no nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis. There is no hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions. There is no evidence of urothelial lesions. The distal ureters and bladder are unremarkable.  GASTROINTESTINAL: In the deep pelvis, there is wall thickening and tethering from the rectosigmoid to sigmoid colon (4:63), with surrounding inflammatory fat stranding, slightly more prominent compared to the prior study from ___, although similar in overall configuration. Mild sigmoid diverticulosis is again noted. There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis. The appendix is unremarkable. Stomach and small bowel loops are normal in size and morphology.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus not visualized. No adnexal abnormalities.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Minimal atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Degenerative changes are most extensive at L4-5 and L5-S1 with disc height loss and endplate sclerosis which has progressed since ___. L5 laminectomy changes are again noted.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT urogram shows no evidence of nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis, ruling out kidney stones as the cause of her pain.  It does, however, reveal wall thickening and tethering from the rectosigmoid to sigmoid colon with surrounding inflammatory fat stranding, suggesting a possible inflammatory process in the bowel. This finding, along with her RLQ pain, makes diverticulitis a strong possibility.  Although she denies a change in bowel habits, this is not always present in diverticulitis.  Her prior cystoscopy findings of erythema and edema, along with recurrent UTIs, suggest a history of bladder inflammation. While these findings are not directly related to her current pain, they are part of her overall picture. The negative cytology results rule out malignancy.  Given the CT findings and her persistent RLQ pain, I believe diverticulitis is the most likely diagnosis.
