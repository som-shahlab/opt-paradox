Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ M, h/o diverticulosis and rectal ca, in USGH until 2d ago when developed multiple episodes of loose mucousy BMs.  Denies melena or hematochezia.  The following day he noted abdominal discomfort, located to the right and just below the umbilicus.  He then experienced one episode of rigors, prompting presentation to ___ ED for evaluation, where he experienced a second episode of rigors.  Mild nausea, no emesis.   Past Medical History: PMH: hyperchol, bladder ca s/p intravesicular BCG, tuberculous prostatitis, rectal ca s/p resection + chemo/XRT, chronic back pain, ? aortic valve thickening PSH: open cholecystectomy ___ (___), R inguinal hernia repair c/b recurrence s/p repair ___ (___), s/p transanal excision of rectal tumor ___ (___), s/p altmeier procedure (BWH), s/p L inguinal hernia    Social History: ___ Family History: FH: colon ca (father)


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of diverticulosis, rectal cancer, and abdominal surgeries, presenting with mucousy diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and rigors. This raises concerns for diverticulitis, an infection related to diverticulosis, or other infectious/inflammatory processes in the abdomen.  Given the history of rectal cancer, metastatic disease or treatment-related complications are also considerations. I need to gather more information to narrow down the possibilities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation is concerning for an infectious process, possibly diverticulitis, given the history of diverticulosis, abdominal pain, and rigors. The lab results show a low WBC count, which is unexpected in the setting of an acute infection and rigors.  The high neutrophil percentage suggests a possible left shift, but the overall low WBC count needs further investigation.  I will order imaging to assess for intra-abdominal pathology.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST matches the requested CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Here's the full report:  TECHNIQUE: Multiple MDCT axial images were obtained from the lung bases through the proximal thighs after the uneventful administration of 130 ml of Optiray intravenously. Enteric contrast was also administered. Multiplanar reformats were derived.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized thorax, the lungs are clear. There is mild bibasilar dependent atelectasis. The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. In the abdomen, the liver, spleen, and adrenals appear normal. The gallbladder is not seen. Multiple hypodensities are seen in the spleen measuring to 8 mm. The kidneys symmetrically take up and excrete contrast without hydronephrosis. Abdominal loops of small bowel appear normal. There is no free air, free fluid, or pathologic lymphadenopathy in the abdomen. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber and course. There are pronounced atherosclerotic calcifications. The takeoff of the celiac axis and SMA are patent. Portal vein appears patent without thrombosis.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is florid sigmoidal diverticulosis. Fat stranding in a segment of central to right-sided colon (series 301B, image 17; series 2, image 61) is consistent with ____. Fat stranding is dense. suggests developing phlegmon. Locules of air proximally (series 300B, image 34 for example) suggest microperforation. The bladder and distal ureters appear normal. There is marked prostatic enlargement to 9.0 x 7.4 cm.  MUSCULOSKELETAL: A well-marginated sclerotic focus in the right proximal femur is stable and likely a bone island. Patchy sclerotic foci in the left iliac are stable. There is no suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion. Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the spine."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with mucousy diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, rigors, and a history of diverticulosis and rectal cancer.  Initial labs revealed a low WBC count with a high neutrophil percentage.  The CT scan demonstrates findings consistent with diverticulitis with associated fat stranding, concerning for a developing phlegmon and possible microperforation.  This explains the patient's symptoms and the concerning finding on the CT scan warrants treatment.  No other concerning findings were noted on the CT scan.
