Patient History:
Mr ___ is a pleasant ___ ___ man with hx of HTN, HLD,  paroxysmal Afib on ___ who presented to the ED today  with one hour of epigastric abdominal pain with radiation to the  back. The patient reports that he awoke from sleep around 4PM  due to the ___, aching, epigastric pain radiating to back.  He  also reports gasping for breath due to pain, as well as nausea  and diaphoresis.  Nothing made it better, asked son to call to  ___ to bring him to the ED.  No difficulty eating, no vomiting.  He denies any diarrhea or dysuria. He has had these symptoms  once before approximately 3 months ago, and underwent a CT A/P,  ___ and had labs. He had a transaminitis but lipase was not  elevated at that time and he has subsequently followed up in  liver clinic where he was diagnosed with likely steatohepatitis.  In the ED, initial vitals were:  98.3, ___, 18, 99% RA.   He was given Zofran, morphine and 1 L NS.  Labs were notable  for transaminitis, elevated alk phos to 133 and lipase of 144.   US showed steatosis, nonmobile echogenic foci along the fundus  of the gallbladder, no e/o obstruction.     On the floor, he states pain is improved with only mild pain  currently which is tolerable and mild nausea.    Review of systems: (+) Per HPI (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats. Denies headache, sinus  tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies cough, shortness of  breath. Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denies   vomiting, diarrhea, constipation .

Past Medical History: - paroxysmal afib on ___ - HTN - HLD, atorvastatin discontinued by PCP - ___ (___) - Left rotator cuff injury with some chronic L delt weakness - Osteoarthritis - OSA   Social History: ___ Family History: (per OMR, confirmed with patient):  Diabetes history with Grandmother, brother.  +Colon cancer with  brother, died in early ___.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric pain radiating to the back, concerning for several potential diagnoses including pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, or even myocardial ischemia given his history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and risk factors for coronary artery disease.  The previous episode 3 months prior with transaminitis but normal lipase and subsequent diagnosis of steatohepatitis adds complexity.  The current presentation with elevated lipase raises concern for pancreatitis, but the ultrasound findings are not specific for acute cholecystitis or biliary obstruction.  Further information is needed to clarify the diagnosis and guide management.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation is consistent with acute pancreatitis given the epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, diaphoresis, and elevated lipase.  The transaminitis is also present, as in his prior episode, but the previous normal lipase and ultrasound findings argue against biliary causes.  While the ultrasound showed steatosis and non-mobile echogenic foci, these are non-specific and don't definitively point to gallbladder pathology. The lack of fever argues against cholangitis.  Although troponin, CRP, CK, and lactate were not available, the normal CBC, CMP (except for transaminases), and other electrolytes make alternative diagnoses less likely.  Given the improvement in pain and nausea with conservative management, I am confident in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.
