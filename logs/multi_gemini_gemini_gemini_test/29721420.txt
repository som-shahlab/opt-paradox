HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ y/o male with history of epigastric  discomfort for many years, always resolving after ___ hours,  not related to eating.  Two days prior to admission, he started having similar epigastric pain  but then developed pain in the RLQ as well, worse with moving  and twisting his body. Does have anorexia and had two episodes of emesis 2 days ago but  none since.  Had frequent bowel movements two days ago as well  but no diarrhea.  The pain waxes and wanes, but he is still  quite tender in the RLQ.  No fever/chills, no dysuria.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: None  Past Surgical History: Wisdom teeth    Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating from the epigastric region to the RLQ, anorexia, and emesis.  This presentation is concerning for appendicitis.  While the waxing and waning nature of the pain and lack of fever are atypical, I need to gather more information to rule out other diagnoses such as mesenteric adenitis, gastroenteritis, or a urologic issue.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign, Murphy's sign,  rectal exam, abdominal auscultation for bowel sounds

ToolMessage:
"On admission:  T: 98.2  P: 105  BP: 141/76  RR: 18  O2sat: 98% on RA General: awake, alert, oriented x 3 HEENT: NCAT, EOMI, anicteric Heart: RRR, NMRG Lungs: CTAB, no respiratory distress Chest: non-tender, no deformities Back: no CVAT Abdomen: soft, ND, locally tender at RLQ without peritoneal signs.  No hernias or masses. Pelvis: deferred Extremities: WWP, no CCE, no tenderness"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical exam reveals localized tenderness in the RLQ without peritoneal signs.  The absence of peritoneal signs lowers the likelihood of acute appendicitis, but it doesn't rule it out completely, especially early in the course of the illness.  The patient's history and exam are still concerning for appendicitis, but other diagnoses like mesenteric adenitis or gastroenteritis are also possible.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis would help differentiate these possibilities.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the full report:  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: Standard departmental protocol CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed with intravenous contrast administration. Coronal and sagittal reformats were obtained. TOTAL EXAM DOSE LENGTH PRODUCT: 552.7 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  ABDOMEN: Visualized lung bases clear. Wedge-shaped hypodensity in the medial left hepatic lobe along the fissure for the falciform ligament most likely represents focal fatty infiltration. Normal-appearing gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, bilateral adrenal glands and kidneys. Normal caliber abdominal aorta. No evidence of lymphadenopathy. Visualized small bowel unremarkable. No evidence of intraperitoneal free air or free fluid. Incidental note of an atretic celiac axis with large superior mesenteric artery supplying the celiac and SMA territory.  PELVIS: Normal-appearing urinary bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles. No evidence of significant inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymphadenopathy. Stool in the rectum. In the right lower quadrant, the appendix is enlarged and fluid filled, measuring 11 mm in diameter, with significant surrounding inflammatory fat stranding, and increased mucosal enhancement. No evidence of surrounding free air or fluid collection or abscess. Findings consistent with acute uncomplicated ____. Visualized osseous structures are unremarkable."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The appendix is enlarged, fluid-filled, and surrounded by inflammatory fat stranding. There is no evidence of perforation or abscess, indicating uncomplicated appendicitis.  The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT results all point to this diagnosis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, showing an enlarged, fluid-filled appendix with surrounding inflammatory fat stranding.  The absence of free air or fluid collection suggests uncomplicated appendicitis.  The incidental finding of an atretic celiac axis is noted but not relevant to the current presentation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Mesenteric adenitis
3. Gastroenteritis
4. Urolithiasis
5. Constipation

Treatment:  The patient should be started on IV fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics with coverage for enteric gram-negative rods and anaerobes (e.g., Cefoxitin, Ertapenem, or Piperacillin/Tazobactam).  A surgical consult should be obtained for laparoscopic appendectomy.  The patient should be kept NPO and monitored for any signs of complications such as perforation or abscess formation.
