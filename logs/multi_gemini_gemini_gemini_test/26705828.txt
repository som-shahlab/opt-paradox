HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with a history of HTN who presented for ERCP.  The patient presented for a triage visit with her PCP's group on ___ with pruritus, RUQ pain, and jaundice. She had also been noticing her stools were light colored. She was not experiencing chest pain or shortness of breath. Nothing obvious brought on  the pain or made it better. ALT was 325, AST 109, AP 272, TB 3.3/DB 2.2, amylase 142.  CT A/P w/ contrast performed on ___ showed a 2.4 x 1.3  1.7cm hypodense lesion in the tail w/ mild PD dilatation up to 3mm. Additionally, a 1.2 x 3.6 x 5.4 cm fluid density collection was seen along the L anterior peritoneal lining between the liver and the L rectus musculature.   Interestingly, no biliary dilatation was noted on the report.   Subsequent MRI w/w/o revealed multiple small cysts in the tail measuring 3.0 x 1.9cm and appear to connect to the PD, likely IPMN.  Mild associated dilatation of the PD up to 3mm.  Again, the liver appeared normal and no bil dil was seen.  She presented for ERCP today with placement of PD stent, sphincterotomy,  brushings and CBD stent.  There was no obvious explanation for jaundice.   After the procedure she is feeling nauseous. VS stable.    Past Medical History: HTN, GERD Left mastectomy for Br Ca. No chemo/rad Cholecystectomy   Social History: ___ Family History: Sister with ___. No GI malignancies known


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with pruritus, RUQ pain, jaundice, and light-colored stools suggests cholestasis. The elevated alkaline phosphatase (AP), total bilirubin (TB), and direct bilirubin (DB) further support this. Despite imaging (CT and MRI) not showing biliary dilatation, the ERCP findings and the patient's persistent jaundice post-procedure warrant further investigation to identify the cause of the obstruction. The nausea post-ERCP is likely a common side effect, but given the overall clinical picture, it's important to rule out any complications.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's significantly elevated lipase points towards pancreatitis, which could explain her RUQ pain and nausea.  The elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, despite no biliary dilatation seen on imaging, suggest a possible obstruction or dysfunction at the sphincter of Oddi. The patient's history of cholecystectomy rules out gallstones as a cause. The anemia (low RBC, hemoglobin, and hematocrit) with elevated RDW could indicate iron deficiency anemia or other underlying hematological issues, which should be investigated further.  Given the elevated lipase, persistent jaundice, and new onset of nausea post-ERCP, I suspect post-ERCP pancreatitis.
