InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with RUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting. Initial CT scan showed cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis. Labs revealed elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, along with significantly elevated lipase, highly suggestive of gallstone pancreatitis.  Although amylase result is unavailable, the markedly elevated lipase is sufficient to support the diagnosis of pancreatitis. The patient underwent ERCP, which likely aimed to relieve the obstruction.  While I don't have the ERCP details, the patient's current lack of pain suggests successful stone removal.  Given the available information, I can provide a reasonable diagnostic impression.
