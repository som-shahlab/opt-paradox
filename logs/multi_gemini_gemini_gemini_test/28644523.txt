HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___, a ___ with a history of hypertension and obstructive  sleep apnea who presents with five days of abdominal pain.  Starting five days before presentation, he had onset of pain in  the lower abdomen bilaterally with associated fevers to 103 and  fatigue. Two days before presentation, the pain localized to the  right lower quadrant. He continues to report fevers and chills.  Denies nausea, vomiting, anorexia   Past Medical History: Obstructive sleep apnea on home CPAP Hypertension Sciatica Depression  PSH: Hemorrhoidectomy ___ years ago) Sinus surgery Right arm benign mass removal ___ years ago)   Social History: ___ Family History: Sister- ___ disease No family history of malignancies


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, fever, and chills, concerning for appendicitis. Given his history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, it's important to rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain such as diverticulitis, kidney stones, or even a hernia.  A physical exam, laboratory tests, and imaging studies are needed to narrow down the diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, and Rovsing's sign), rectal exam

ToolMessage:
"Vitals: T: 98.0, HR:70,  BP: 148 / 81 RR: 18, 94% RA General- well-appearing, NAD HEENT- PERRL, EOMI, sclera anicteric, moist mucus membranes Cardiac- RRR Chest- no respiratory distress, CTAB Abdomen- soft, non tender, nondistended. Negative Rovsing and  obdurator sign, positive psoas sign. No rebound or guarding.  Ext- no clubbing, cyanosis or edema"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, fever, and chills, concerning for appendicitis. The physical exam reveals a positive psoas sign, further increasing the suspicion for appendicitis.  While the abdomen is soft and non-tender now, the prior history of tenderness, fever, and chills along with the positive psoas sign still points towards appendicitis.  Imaging is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast.  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 1,023 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Mild dependent and subsegmental atelectasis, right greater than left. No focal consolidations. No pleural or pericardial effusion. Moderate aortic valvular calcifications are visualized. Normal heart size.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: Prominence of the main pancreatic duct in the region of the pancreatic head. Otherwise, the pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. Accessory spleen anteriorly.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: Simple cyst within the interpolar region of the left kidney. Otherwise, the kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of enhancing renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: There is extensive fat stranding and fluid within the right lower quadrant. The appendix is dilated and fluid-filled measuring up to 2.2 cm (series 2, image 65) with hyperemic walls and adjacent phlegmonous change. There appears to be an appendicolith at the appendiceal base, also seen on series 2, image 65. There is disruption of the appendiceal wall with extraluminal foci of air and a developing fluid collection, which currently measures approximately 3.7 x 2.5 x 4.9 cm (series 2, image 65). These findings are consistent with ____. There is no evidence of distant pneumoperitoneum. Wall thickening affecting the terminal ileum and cecum as well as the adjacent sigmoid colon is likely reactive in nature. Prominent adjacent lymph nodes are low also likely reactive in nature. Otherwise, the small and large bowel are unremarkable in appearance. No bowel obstruction. Mild circumferential wall thickening of the distal esophageal wall may be due to esophagitis. The stomach is unremarkable.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate and seminal vesicles are normal.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Moderate atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: Small fat containing umbilical hernia. There is also a small fat containing left inguinal hernia."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with right lower quadrant pain, fever, chills, and positive psoas sign raised suspicion for appendicitis. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of perforated appendicitis with a dilated, fluid-filled appendix, appendicolith, and extraluminal air and fluid collection.  The patient requires urgent surgical intervention.
