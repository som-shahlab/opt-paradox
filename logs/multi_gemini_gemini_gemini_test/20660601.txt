Patient History:
___ with a history of HTN, CKD, BPH status post two prostate surgeries (most recent TURP was ___, multiple urological procedures since childhood, and recurrent UTI, who initially presented to ___ with fevers, malaise, and left scrotal swelling status post operative I&D of scrotum on ___, subsequently found to be in complete heart block, transferred to ___ for temporary pacing wire placement.   Patient presented to ___ on ___ with ___ days of scrotal swelling, malaise, and subjective fevers. Reported gradually increasing left sided scrotal swelling with overlying redness, which was non-tender, and not associated with any urological symptoms. Straight caths ___ times a day at baseline; did not notice any changes in consistency or smell of urine. Did not measure his temperature, but subjectively felt warm. Denied other infectious symptoms including abdominal pain, diarrhea/constipation, shortness of breath, cough, or nasal congestion. No recent sexual intercourse.  At ___, he was noted to have an elevated WBC of 16.2, and urine studies were notable for positive nitrites, ___ RBCs, ___ WBCs, 3+ bacteria, and 2+ epithelial cells. Patient was started on IV Zosyn for possible epididymitis and UTI and  urology were consulted. Unfortunately no subsequent records were sent with the patient and BID Community ___ was not working for the patient upon arrival. Per transfer email; "Patient went into the OR today (___) for an I&D of the left scrotal abscess and was found to be in complete heart block after the procedure." Transferred to ___ for temporary PPM.  On further questioning, patient reports checking his pulse on a regular basis when he is at home.

Thought: The patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, recent scrotal swelling and I&D, and now complete heart block.  It's crucial to determine the cause of the infection, assess the extent of his cardiac issues, and evaluate his renal function given his CKD history.  The relationship between the infection, heart block, and his other medical conditions needs to be clarified.

Thought: The patient's lab results show an elevated WBC count with neutrophilia, suggestive of an ongoing infection.  The urinalysis shows proteinuria, hematuria, and leukocyturia, which, combined with his history of scrotal swelling and I&D, points towards a complicated UTI or possibly pyelonephritis.  His elevated BUN and creatinine suggest worsening renal function, likely related to his underlying CKD and potentially exacerbated by the infection. The elevated INR raises concern for an underlying coagulopathy, although the PTT is normal.  Blood cultures and urine culture results are still needed to identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic therapy.  Troponin, CRP, and ESR would help assess for other potential causes of his symptoms and complete heart block, such as myocarditis or pericarditis.  A physical exam, including a cardiovascular assessment, is necessary to evaluate his current condition.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Cardiovascular exam (auscultation for murmurs, rubs, gallops; assessment of heart rate and rhythm),  Abdominal exam (palpation for tenderness, masses), Genitourinary exam (inspection of the scrotum and penis for swelling, redness, discharge),  Pulmonary exam (auscultation of lung fields), Neurological exam (assessment of mental status, cranial nerves, motor and sensory function)

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a complicated UTI with scrotal involvement, complete heart block requiring a temporary pacemaker, and worsening renal function.  His physical exam reveals a fever, hypertension, and bradycardia consistent with the heart block.  The abdominal exam suggests possible bladder distension, and the scrotal dressing indicates ongoing drainage.  While the cause of the complete heart block remains unclear, the lack of other significant physical exam findings argues against acute processes like myocarditis or pericarditis.  The patient's history of multiple urological procedures, recurrent UTIs, and recent scrotal I&D, combined with the lab findings and physical exam, strongly suggest that the current infection is the primary driver of his presentation.  The development of complete heart block could be related to the infection, either directly or indirectly through electrolyte imbalances or other systemic effects.  Given the available information, further investigations are unlikely to significantly alter the management plan, which should focus on treating the infection, optimizing renal function, and evaluating the need for a permanent pacemaker.
