HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a previously healthy ___ year old female with no prior medical history presenting to the ED with acute onset abdominal pain. At first the pain was generalized, but has progressively moved down her abdomen. She also became nauseated and started vomiting. She presented to the ED for these two symptoms. The pain was crampy in nature and not alleviated or exacerbated by anything. She denies fevers, but has had chills since the onset of symptoms. She denies any change in her bowel habits prior to presenting to the ED, denies hematemesis, hematochezia, or melena. She has no history of surgery.   Past Medical History: asthma   Social History: ___ Family History: denies family history of cancers


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is presenting with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and chills. The pain migration to the lower abdomen is concerning for appendicitis.  Given the patient's age and sex, other differentials include ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy (if applicable), pelvic inflammatory disease (if applicable), and other gastrointestinal issues. I need more information to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, obturator sign, psoas sign), pelvic exam (if female and age-appropriate)

ToolMessage:
"On admission: T:   P:   BP: /  RR:   O2sat: % on  General: awake, alert, oriented x 3, extremely anxious, tearful HEENT: NCAT Heart: RRR, NMRG Lungs: CTAB, normal excursion Chest: non-tender Abdomen: soft, ND, obese, + Rosvings sign, minimal right lower quadrant tenderness, Skin: no rashes, no lesions,  no ulcers"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute lower abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting, chills, and a positive Rovsing's sign raises strong suspicion for appendicitis.  However, other diagnoses like ovarian torsion or pelvic inflammatory disease are still possible. Laboratory tests and imaging are needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other conditions.
Action: laboratory tests

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chills, a positive Rovsing's sign, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia, strongly suggests appendicitis.  The negative pregnancy test rules out ectopic pregnancy. While the urinalysis is unremarkable, it doesn't definitively exclude other possibilities like a urinary tract infection or kidney stones, though these are less likely given the exam findings.  Imaging is necessary to confirm appendicitis and visualize the appendix.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired from the liver to the pubic symphysis after the uneventful administration of 130 mL of Omnipaque. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were provided and reviewed. DLP: 512.63 mGy/cm.  FINDINGS: Abdomen: The imaged lung bases show no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The imaged heart is normal in size and there is no pericardial effusion. The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesions. The gallbladder is normal and there is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The spleen, splenule, pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast without hydronephrosis. The stomach, large and small bowel are normal. The ascending and transverse colons are collapsed. The appendix is dilated, measuring 8 mm, and surrounded by fat stranding. There is no adjacent fluid collection or extraluminal air. Focal dilation of the terminal ileum may reflect a reactive ileus. There is no evidence for small bowel obstruction. Additionally, multiple prominent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are thought to be reactive in etiology. The aorta and major branches are unremarkable. The portal vein, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein are patent.  Pelvis: The bladder, uterus, rectum and sigmoid are normal. Follicular activity is seen within both ovaries. There is no free pelvic fluid. There is no inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymphadenopathy.  Bones: There are no concerning lytic or blastic osseous lesions."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, nausea, vomiting, chills, and a positive Rovsing's sign.  Physical exam revealed right lower quadrant tenderness.  Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis and neutrophilia.  CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast demonstrates a dilated appendix measuring 8mm surrounded by fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis. The other abdominal and pelvic organs are unremarkable.  Based on the totality of the findings, the diagnosis of acute appendicitis is confirmed.
Action: done

Treatment: The patient requires an appendectomy.  Given the uncomplicated nature of the appendicitis based on the CT findings, a laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred approach.  She should be given intravenous fluids for hydration and pre-operative antibiotics (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of Cefazolin, Metronidazole, and an aminoglycoside) to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.
