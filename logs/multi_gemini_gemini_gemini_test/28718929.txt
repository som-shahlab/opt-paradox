Thought: The patient presents with acute bilateral lower abdominal pain, nausea, and a family history of Factor V Leiden. This raises concerns for several potential diagnoses, including ovarian torsion, appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, or a thromboembolic event.  I need to gather more information to narrow down the possibilities.

Thought: The patient's labs are largely normal, though Beta-hCG and urinalysis are still outstanding.  Given the patient's acute onset bilateral lower abdominal pain, nausea, and family history of Factor V Leiden, I would want to rule out ovarian and uterine pathology, as well as other abdominal/pelvic issues.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Pelvic ultrasound, CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Among the available imaging studies, the CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST best matches the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast, though it's not an exact match since it was performed without contrast. Here's the full report:  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST:  EXAMINATION: Second radiographs 4 CT abdomen and pelvis  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration at an outside institution. Coronal and sagittal reformations were provided. Oral contrast was not administered.  DOSE: DLP: 667.45 mGy-cm  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: Within the left upper quadrant, there is a 8.6 x 7.2 x7.2 cm, relatively homogeneously hypodense (30 ___, lobulated well-defined mass which contains 1 punctate calcification (___). This lesion appears separate from the spleen, left kidney, and left adrenal gland. There is loss of the fat plane between it and the adjacent posterior wall of the gastric fundus (02:11), however, this mass does not appear to be arising from the gastric wall. The lesion also appears to abut the superior aspect of the distal pancreatic body. A smaller, adjacent hypodense lesion located anteriorly in the left upper quadrant measures 1.6 x 1.5 cm (02:18) demonstrates similar imaging features.  HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The left kidney demonstrate significant perinephric stranding and potential soft tissue density (45 ___, as well as several calcifications noted to abut the superior pole of the left kidney. Inferior to the kidney, within the retroperitoneum, there are 2 rounded heterogeneous mass containing bulk fat and stranding measuring 3.5 x 3.0 cm and 2.7 x 2.9 cm (02:39), respectively. Assessment for enhancing soft tissue components within these lesions is limited on this exam. These lesions do not appear to arise from the kidney to suggest angiomyolipomas. The right kidney is normal in appearance. No hydronephrosis or hydroureter is identified. Both kidneys enhance symmetrically.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach appears unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is dilated and fluid-filled measuring up to 9 mm in diameter (___), and contains an appendicolith near the cecal base (2:60). The cecal base itself appears to demonstrate mild mural thickening. The appendiceal wall, however, is not thickened or hyperemic, and there are no significant surrounding inflammatory changes. No free air or free fluid is identified.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is a trace amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus demonstrates at least one fibroid. No adnexal masses are present.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  NOTIFICATION: Findings were conveyed by Dr. ___ to the ACS team at 23:00 on ___.  The requested pelvic ultrasound is not available in the provided imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan reveals an enlarged appendix with an appendicolith, suggestive of appendicitis. While the report notes the absence of significant inflammatory changes, the presence of an appendicolith and dilated appendix, combined with the patient's symptoms of acute lower abdominal pain and nausea, strongly points towards appendicitis.  The other findings on the CT scan, such as the left upper quadrant mass and perinephric stranding, are less likely to be causing the patient's acute symptoms.  Although a pelvic ultrasound was requested, the CT findings are sufficient to make a diagnosis.

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute lower abdominal pain and nausea. While many of her labs are normal, imaging reveals an enlarged appendix with an appendicolith, concerning for appendicitis. The lack of significant inflammatory changes around the appendix could suggest early appendicitis. Other findings, such as the left upper quadrant mass and perinephric stranding, require further investigation but are less likely to be the cause of her acute symptoms.  Given the concerning finding in the appendix, I would prioritize appendicitis as the most likely diagnosis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian cyst
3. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)
4. Ectopic pregnancy
5. Ureterolithiasis

Treatment:  Given the suspicion for appendicitis, the patient should be made NPO and given IV fluids.  A surgical consultation should be obtained for evaluation and possible appendectomy.  If the surgical team feels that the imaging is not definitive for appendicitis, a repeat CT scan with IV contrast may be helpful to better assess the appendix and surrounding tissues.  Pain management should be provided with analgesics.  A pregnancy test should be performed to definitively rule out ectopic pregnancy.  Further investigation of the left upper quadrant mass and perinephric stranding should be pursued after addressing the potential appendicitis. This may involve additional imaging studies (e.g., MRI abdomen) and/or biopsy.
