HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old female presents with RUQ and epigastric pain and  nausea for 12hrs. Patient reports she had gradual onset of crampy abdominal pain in RUQ and all along her inferior ribs radiating to her  back about 2 hrs after dinner aroumd 8pm without much relief, associated with some nausea but no emesis. This is first time occurence.  Upon presentation, patient had normal vital signs, WBC 10.1 (N88%), AST 20, ALP 53, Tbili 0.4, Lip 43 and RUQ showing gallstones in a partly distended gallbladder with signs of wall thickening and pericholecystic fluid and + ___  sign. She was given 1 dose of ciprofloxacin and flagyl in the ED. Otherwise denies any fevers, chills, melena, diarrhea/constipation.    Past Medical History: HTN, nephrolithiasis    Social History: ___ ___ History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is presenting with RUQ pain, nausea, and a positive Murphy's sign, along with imaging findings suggestive of cholecystitis.  I need to know the patient's age, smoking status, and the specific imaging modality used to visualize the gallbladder to complete my assessment.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Ultrasound of the abdomen

ToolMessage:
"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound) best matches the requested abdominal ultrasound. Here is the full report:  TECHNIQUE: Grey scale and color Doppler ultrasound images of the abdomen were obtained.  FINDINGS:  LIVER: Slightly increased heterogeneity of the right lobe of the liver is noted without discrete mass. The echogenicity of the left lobe of the liver is homogeneous. The contour of the liver is smooth. Main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is no ascites.  BILE DUCTS: There is no intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  GALLBLADDER: The gallbladder is partly distended with stones and mild wall thickening. A phrygian cap is noted with additional gallstones. There is a small amount of pericholecystic fluid. The sonographic ___ sign is positive.  PANCREAS: The head and body of the pancreas are within normal limits, without masses or pancreatic ductal dilatation. The tail of the pancreas is not well assessed due to overlying bowel gas.  KIDNEYS: Limited assessment right kidney shows no hydronephrosis. A 4 mm stone is seen in the lower pole of the right kidney.  RETROPERITONEUM: Visualized portions of aorta and IVC are within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: This patient is presenting with a classic picture of acute cholecystitis.  She has RUQ pain radiating to the back, nausea, a positive Murphy's sign, and ultrasound findings of gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, and pericholecystic fluid.  Knowing her age and smoking status would help assess surgical risk, but I have enough information to recommend a surgical consult.
Action: done
