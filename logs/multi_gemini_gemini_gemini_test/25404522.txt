HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___. male p/w abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting x 1 day.  Pain started as diffuse abdominal pain, evolved into focal RLQ pain.  Passing stools and flatus.  Denies fever/chills.    Past Medical History: Psoriasis, hip pain, chondromalacia patellae.   Past Surgical History:   Hip injections, R knee arthroscopy     Family History: Noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting with pain migration from diffuse to focal RLQ pain. This raises suspicion for appendicitis.  Passing gas and stool argues against an obstruction, but does not rule out appendicitis.  I need to gather more information through physical exam to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on RLQ tenderness, McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign, Rebound tenderness, Murphy's sign,  Guarding, Rigidity

ToolMessage:
"Upon presentation to ___: Temp:98.1 HR:60 BP:136/80 Resp:14 O(2)Sat:100 Normal   Constitutional: Comfortable HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic Chest: Clear to auscultation Cardiovascular: Regular Rate and Rhythm, Normal first and second heart sounds Abdominal: Soft, Nondistended, TTP in RLQ with rebound; no Rosving's Neuro: Speech fluent Psych: Normal mood, Normal mentation"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and focal RLQ tenderness with rebound.  The presentation and physical exam findings are highly suspicious for appendicitis. While the patient denies fever/chills and is passing gas and stool, these findings do not rule out appendicitis. Given the concerning findings, I will recommend further evaluation with imaging to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Contiguous MDCT images through the abdomen and pelvis was performed after administration of intravenous contrast. Axial, coronal, and sagittal reformats were acquired.  FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Lung bases are clear. Multiple small hypoattenuating lesions in the liver, too small to characterize, but most likely representing simple cysts. The gallbladder is normal. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. There are multiple hypoattenuating lesions in both kidneys, too small to characterize, but likely representing simple cysts. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, stones, or renal masses. There are scattered retroperitoneal lymph nodes, not meeting CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. No mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no free air and no free fluid. The portal venous, systemic venous, and systemic arterial system of the abdomen and pelvis are normal. The esophagus, stomach, and small bowel are normal. The appendix is dilated up to 19 mm at the base and is fluid filled with a tiny appendicolith (series 300B, image 24). There is significant periappendiceal fat stranding, but no evidence of abscess formation or perforation. The remainder of the large bowel is normal.  CT OF THE PELVIS: Small amount of free fluid in the rectovesical space. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy. The urinary bladder, prostate are normal. There are no pelvic hernias.  BONES: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions. There are mild degenerative changes at the hip joints with subchondral cysts."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  Physical exam revealed RLQ tenderness with rebound.  CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis with a dilated, fluid-filled appendix, an appendicolith, and periappendiceal fat stranding.  The patient's presentation, physical exam, and imaging are consistent with acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of abdominal pain migrating to the RLQ, nausea, vomiting, and RLQ tenderness with rebound tenderness raised suspicion for appendicitis. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, showing a dilated appendix with an appendicolith and periappendiceal fat stranding.  The findings support a diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Gastroenteritis
4. Ovarian Cyst (if female)
5. Urinary Tract Infection

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment for acute appendicitis.  This can be performed laparoscopically or open, with laparoscopic appendectomy being the preferred approach in most cases.  The patient should be given intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antibiotics (covering gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria) preoperatively.  Post-operative care includes pain management, wound care, and monitoring for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  The patient should be advised to follow up with their surgeon for post-operative evaluation.
