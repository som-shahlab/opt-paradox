InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms concerning for acute cholangitis on a background of choledocholithiasis and cholecystitis. Given her history of chronic prednisone use, it's important to consider the possibility of immunosuppression and increased risk of infection.  Her elevated lactate, leukocytosis, and abnormal liver function tests further support the diagnosis of cholangitis. The patient also has a history of resolved hepatitis B, which could be relevant to her current liver function.  I need to assess her current hepatitis B status to rule out reactivation.  Additionally, the patient's hypoxia and CXR findings raise concerns about a possible lower respiratory tract infection. I will request additional tests to investigate these possibilities.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis B e antigen, Hepatitis B core antibody, IgM,  blood cultures, sputum culture

Thought: The patient's presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results strongly suggest acute cholangitis secondary to choledocholithiasis and cholecystitis.  The elevated WBC, abnormal LFTs, and imaging findings of biliary dilation and gallstones support this.  The patient's history of chronic prednisone use likely contributed to the severity of her presentation. While additional information regarding her hepatitis B status and potential respiratory infection would be helpful, I have enough information to recommend appropriate management for her primary diagnosis of acute cholangitis.

* **NPO:**  Maintain the patient NPO in preparation for ERCP.
* **Hepatitis B workup:**  Obtain HBsAg, HBeAg, and HBcAb IgM to assess for reactivation.
* **Further investigation of pulmonary findings:** Repeat CXR at full inspiration and consider sputum cultures if respiratory symptoms worsen or persist.
* **Surgical consultation:** Continue close follow-up with surgery for possible cholecystectomy after the acute cholangitis is resolved.
* **Monitor vital signs and lactate:** Closely monitor for signs of clinical improvement or deterioration.
