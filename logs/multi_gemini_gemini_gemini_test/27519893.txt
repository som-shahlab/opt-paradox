HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This is a ___ with no prior surgical history presenting with  gradual onset diffuse abdominal pain that has since migrated to  the RLQ and intensified. He states his symptoms started this  morning at 0200 when he noticed vague abdominal pain. This  gradually intensified and when he woke up this morning noticed  it had shifted to the RLQ. He took a single dose of Norfloxacin  (unclear when he obtained this medication), without relief of  his symptoms. His last meal was at 10PM yesterday evening. He  denies constipation, diarrhea, emesis, night sweats, chills but  endorses subjective fevers and diminished appetite. No dysuria,  hematuria, urgency, frequency, lightheadedness, dizziness. He  had a similar episode of abdominal pain ___ years ago, but was  treated with antibiotics.     Past Medical History: Anxiety   Social History: ___ Family History: No family history of inflammatory bowel disease.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, fever, and anorexia, concerning for appendicitis.  Given the prior episode of abdominal pain treated with antibiotics, it's important to gather more information to rule out other diagnoses like a kidney stone, diverticulitis, or inflammatory bowel disease.  The patient's age and gender would be helpful in assessing risk factors for these conditions.  Additionally, vital signs including temperature and heart rate are crucial to assess the severity of the illness.  A physical exam focusing on the abdomen is necessary to evaluate for tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness.  Finally, laboratory tests are needed to look for signs of infection and inflammation.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam including palpation for tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation is consistent with appendicitis.  The initial vague abdominal pain migrating to the RLQ, accompanied by fever and anorexia, are classic symptoms. While the tenderness has resolved, this could be due to the Norfloxacin masking the symptoms. The prior episode of abdominal pain treated with antibiotics raises the possibility of recurrent appendicitis or another inflammatory process.  The normal vital signs and lack of rebound/guarding on exam are reassuring, but do not rule out appendicitis.  A CT scan is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for other potential causes of abdominal pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT Abdomen & Pelvis with Contrast report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 2.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 9.6 mGy (Body) DLP = 4.8 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 6.4 s, 50.6 cm; CTDIvol = 18.2 mGy (Body) DLP = 919.5 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 924 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Lungs are clear bilaterally. There is no pleural effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is abnormal, appearing fluid-filled and dilated up to 1.4 cm in largest diameter. There is mild surrounding mesenteric fat stranding. Hyperdense material is seen in the proximal portion of the appendiceal lumen as well as distally and represent appendicoliths.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate and seminal vesicles are normal.  LYMPH NODES: There are prominent lymph nodes in the ileocolic region in the right lower quadrant including adjacent to the appendix (02:57), which are likely reactive. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, demonstrating a dilated appendix with appendicoliths and surrounding fat stranding. The prominent lymph nodes in the ileocolic region are likely reactive.  The patient's presentation, history, and imaging findings all point to appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, fever, and anorexia, along with the CT findings of a dilated appendix with appendicoliths and surrounding fat stranding, confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The prior episode of abdominal pain treated with antibiotics could have been a previous, milder case of appendicitis that resolved without surgery.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Early Diverticulitis
3. Epiploic Appendagitis
