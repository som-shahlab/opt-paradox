InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a complex medical history including congenitally absent infrarenal IVC, lower extremity venous stasis, multiple DVTs, and ESRD on HD.  The current complaint is LLQ abdominal pain with associated N/V, chills, and inability to tolerate PO. Given the history of DVTs, it's crucial to rule out acute mesenteric ischemia or other vascular complications. The patient's history of venous stasis ulcers and necrotizing fasciitis raises concern for possible infection or inflammatory process in the abdomen. The cough and possible sputum production could indicate a respiratory infection, which could be contributing to the patient's overall condition.  I need more information to narrow down the differential diagnosis.
