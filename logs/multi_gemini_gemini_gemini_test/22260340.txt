HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ who awoke from sleep on ___ following  approximately 26 hours of hours of RUQ pain with shaking and  chills.  He denies fevers.  At time of presentation, pt reported  several episodes of non-bilious emesis. Pt was intially seen at  an OSH, where a RUQ U/S was notable for distended gallbladder,  mildly thickened wall, common bile duct dilation to 10 mm. Given  these findings in conjuction with elevated LFTs, pt was  transferred to ___ for further management and work-up.     Past Medical History: hypertension, BPH    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain, shaking chills, and non-bilious emesis.  The dilated common bile duct (CBD) and thickened gallbladder wall raise suspicion for choledocholithiasis. Elevated LFTs further support this. To determine the best course of action, I need to know the specific LFT values, complete blood count (CBC) to assess for signs of infection, and lipase to evaluate for pancreatitis.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, CBC with differential, lipase

ToolMessage:
"Here are the results for the requested tests:  AST: 344.0 IU/L ALT: 370.0 IU/L Alkaline Phosphatase: 199.0 IU/L Total Bilirubin: 7.6 mg/dL Direct Bilirubin: Not available in the lab results  Complete Blood Count (CBC) with differential: - White Blood Cells: 17.3 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 4.45 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 15.0 g/dL - Hematocrit: 42.4% - Platelet Count: 187.0 K/uL - Differential:   * Neutrophils: 88.0%   * Bands: 7.0%   * Lymphocytes: 2.0%   * Monocytes: 1.0%   * Eosinophils: 1.0%   * Basophils: 0.0%   * Atypical Lymphocytes: 1.0%  Lipase: 15.0 IU/L"

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, imaging findings (distended gallbladder, thickened wall, CBD dilation), and laboratory results (elevated AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, WBC count, neutrophils, and bands) are highly suggestive of acute cholangitis, likely secondary to choledocholithiasis.  The normal lipase makes pancreatitis less likely.  The patient requires urgent biliary drainage.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain, shaking chills, non-bilious emesis, and a dilated common bile duct. The ultrasound findings of a distended gallbladder with a mildly thickened wall, along with the elevated LFTs (AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin), strongly suggest choledocholithiasis. The elevated white blood cell count with a left shift (high neutrophils and bands) indicates an acute inflammatory process, likely due to the biliary obstruction. The normal lipase makes pancreatitis less likely.  The absence of fever is unusual but doesn't rule out choledocholithiasis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Choledocholithiasis
2. Acute Cholangitis
3. Acute Cholecystitis
4. Gallbladder sludge
5. Pancreatitis

Treatment:  The patient requires admission for IV fluids, antibiotics to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Piperacillin-Tazobactam, or Ceftriaxone plus Metronidazole), pain control, and monitoring. An ERCP should be performed urgently to remove the stone from the common bile duct and relieve the obstruction.  A cholecystectomy may be considered during the same admission or later, depending on the patient's overall condition and surgical risk.
