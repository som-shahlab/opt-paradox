HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This patient is a ___ year old male who complains of RLQ abdominal pain x24 hrs. He says initially he had lower abdominal pain which then migrated and became concentrated in the right lower quadrant. This was associated with nausea and vomiting of stomach contents at least 5 times, non bilious, non bloody. Patient had a normal bowel movement earlier today without diarrhea, melena, or blood. He denies fevers or chills. He's never had this pain before. There are no urinary symptoms, no testicular pain or swelling.    Past Medical History: PMH: remote hx non-active TB PSH: surgery for undescended testicle as a child    Social History: ___ Family History: non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and migration of pain from the lower abdomen is suggestive of appendicitis.  However, to make an informed decision, I need the patient's age and more information about the pain characteristics, vital signs, and physical exam findings.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, palpation including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign, rebound tenderness),  assessment for guarding and rigidity

ToolMessage:
"Temp 97.7   HR 77   BP 160/80   RR 20   O2 sat 100% RA A&Ox3, NAD RRR CTAB soft, ND, tender to palpation in RLQ, no guarding or rebound no extr edema"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and migration of pain from the lower abdomen is highly suspicious for appendicitis.  The physical exam findings of RLQ tenderness further support this. While the lack of guarding, rebound tenderness, and fever argue against it, these findings can be absent in early appendicitis.  Given the concerning presentation, I would proceed with imaging to evaluate for appendicitis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following the uneventful intravenous administration of 130 mL of Optiray contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also reviewed.  CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The lung bases and cardiac apex are normal. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys are normal. There is no free gas or fluid in the upper abdomen. Regional vascular structures are normal. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: The urinary bladder, distal ureters, prostate, seminal vesicles, rectum and colon are normal. The appendix is dilated, most notably near its tip where it measures 13 mm in diameter (300B:29). Additionally, it is notable for mucosal hyperenhancement, is fluid filled and note is also made of surrounding fat stranding and thickening of the adjacent fascia. There is no free gas or fluid in the pelvis. There is no evidence of appendiceal rupture or appendicolith. There is no pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  OSSEOUS FINDINGS: There is no suspicious sclerotic or lytic osseous lesion."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, migration of pain, and the CT findings of a dilated appendix with mucosal hyperenhancement, fluid filling, surrounding fat stranding, and thickening of the adjacent fascia are consistent with acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, migration of pain from the lower abdomen, and the CT findings of a dilated appendix with mucosal hyperenhancement, fluid filling, surrounding fat stranding, and thickening of the adjacent fascia confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The absence of an appendicolith or rupture suggests uncomplicated appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Right ureteral calculus
4. Epiploic appendagitis.
5. Cecal diverticulitis

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy.  Since the CT scan does not show evidence of perforation or abscess, a laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred approach.  The patient should be given intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem, or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole).  Post-operatively, the patient should be monitored for complications such as infection, bleeding, and ileus.  The patient should be discharged home once they are tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, and pain is controlled.  They should be instructed to follow up with their surgeon for wound check and removal of sutures/staples.
