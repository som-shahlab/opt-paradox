HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old, otherwise healthy male who presented with several hours of abdominal pain.  He initially had diffuse bloating and aching abdominal pain, along with nausea, weakness, malaise, and loss of appetite.  The pain then localized to the right lower quadrant, was sometimes sharp, ___ in severity at its worst, and aggravated by movement and deep breathing.  There was also some less severe ___ pain.    He has not vomited.  He has passed flatus and had a non-bloody bowel movement this evening.  He was transported to the ___ ED by ambulance, and felt more severe pain (like someone hit him in the right lower quadrant) when the ambulance drove over bumps in the road.  He has not had recent abdominal trauma, and has not experienced abdominal pain like this before.    Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: - Paternal grandmother had a stroke - Maternal grandmother had cancer (exact type unspecified)


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation suggests appendicitis.  The initial diffuse pain followed by localization to the right lower quadrant, along with nausea, anorexia, and pain exacerbated by movement are concerning for this.  However, I need more information to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities like mesenteric adenitis, ovarian torsion (if female), or a kidney stone.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign),  rectal exam

ToolMessage:
"Admission Physical Exam  Vitals:  T 97.6, HR 62, BP 149/70, RR 15, O2 100% ___ GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, no guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses.  Tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant, with rebound and positive Rovsing sign. Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including initial diffuse abdominal pain followed by localization to the right lower quadrant, anorexia, nausea, and tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant with rebound and positive Rovsing's sign, strongly suggests appendicitis.  The absence of guarding does not rule out appendicitis.  Given the concerning findings, I would proceed with imaging to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis following the administration of 130 cc of Omnipaque intravenous contrast material and without oral contrast material. Reformatted coronal and sagittal images were obtained. DOSE: DLP: 395 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  THORAX: The visualized lung bases are clear with no pleural effusions, pneumothorax or focal opacities. The visualized heart and pericardium are normal.  LIVER: The liver enhances homogeneously with no focal lesions. The portal and hepatic veins are patent, and there is no intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.  GALLBLADDER: The gallbladder is unremarkable and contains no radiopaque gallstones.  SPLEEN: The spleen is normal in size and shape.  PANCREAS: The pancreas enhances homogeneously without ductal dilation or peripancreatic fat stranding.  ADRENALS: The adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  KIDNEYS: The kidneys are normal in size and shape. The kidneys have appropriate contrast enhancement and excretion bilaterally. There is no hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding.  BOWEL: The stomach is mildly distended and unremarkable. The small bowel is without obstruction or focal wall thickening. The appendix is retrocecal, has wall hyperemia and is dilated measuring 8 mm (601B:32). There is also surrounding fat stranding, and a appendicolith is noted (601b:32, 2:52). There is no evidence of perforation or fluid collection. The large bowel contains feces without wall thickening or evidence of obstruction. There is no intraperitoneal free air or free fluid.  LYMPH NODES: There are no pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes by CT size criteria.  PELVIS: The bladder is relatively well distended without focal wall thickening. There is no pelvic free fluid. There are no pathologically enlarged pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymph nodes by CT size criteria. The rectum is unremarkable.  VESSELS & SOFT TISSUE: There is no aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta. The aorta and its major branches are patent. There are no hernias.  BONES: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions to suggest malignancy. No fracture or dislocation is seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT scan confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The CT scan demonstrates a retrocecal appendix with wall hyperemia, dilatation, surrounding fat stranding, and an appendicolith, all consistent with acute appendicitis.  There is no evidence of perforation.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, demonstrating a dilated appendix with wall hyperemia, surrounding fat stranding, and an appendicolith.  There is no evidence of perforation.  This information, combined with the patient's history and physical exam findings, points definitively to appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Right Lower Quadrant Pain (nonspecific)
4. Ovarian Torsion (if female, less likely given presentation)
5. Kidney Stone (less likely given lack of flank pain and hematuria)

Treatment:  The patient should undergo an appendectomy.  This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on surgeon preference and patient factors.  Preoperatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics (e.g., a second-generation cephalosporin such as cefoxitin or cefuroxime plus metronidazole) to cover common enteric organisms.  Postoperatively, the patient should receive pain control, continue antibiotics as indicated, and be monitored for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  The patient should be educated on wound care and follow-up.
