HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with a history significant  for undifferentiated gastric cancer s/p total gastrectomy with a  Roux-en-y reconstruction and feeding jejunostomy on ___ who  presented to the ___ ED from his rehab facility on ___  with ___ days of severe RUQ abdominal pain accompanied by  worsening nausea.  His was discharged from his most recent  hospitalization on ___ to ___.  Of note, on his previous hospitalization an incidental lung  nodule was found on CT which should be followed.   Past Medical History: AMBLYOPIA   ANXIETY STATES, UNSPEC   Colonic adenoma   Anemia   Weight loss   B12 deficiency   Vitamin d deficiency   PVC (premature ventricular contraction)      Social History: ___ Family History: father died at ___ from skin cancer mother died from old age


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is presenting with severe RUQ abdominal pain after a total gastrectomy with Roux-en-y reconstruction.  This raises concerns for several post-surgical complications such as bile leak, obstruction, or infection.  Given the recent discharge and history of incidental lung nodule, it's also important to consider other potential causes like pneumonia or pulmonary embolism, although the location of the pain makes these less likely.  I need more information about the nature of the pain, vital signs, and laboratory results to narrow down the differential diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show signs of infection (elevated WBC and neutrophils), acute kidney injury (elevated BUN and creatinine), and coagulopathy (elevated PT, INR, and PTT).  The elevated lipase suggests pancreatitis, which could be causing the RUQ pain.  The hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and low bicarbonate could be due to dehydration or other electrolyte imbalances.  The elevated alkaline phosphatase could be related to biliary obstruction or bone disease.  I need imaging to further evaluate the abdomen and assess for pancreatitis, biliary obstruction, or other causes of the patient's symptoms.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images were obtained from lung bases through the pubic symphysis after administration 130 cc Omnipaque intravenous contrast material as well as barium-containing enteric contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats prepared and reviewed.  FINDINGS: The lower chest is unremarkable.  ABDOMEN: The gallbladder is moderately distended. Although there is no frank edema, the wall appears indistinct and hazy at several points. There are a number of radiopaque gallstones within the neck of the gallbladder and in the cystic duct (2:23). There is trace pericholecystic free fluid (___). The liver enhances homogeneously and is without focal abnormality. There is no intra or extrahepatic bile duct dilation. The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands appear normal. There are a number of simple cysts in both kidneys with several additional smaller hypodensities which are too small to characterize by CT. The kidneys otherwise enhance normally and excrete contrast symmetrically. There are expected surgical changes associated with gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y procedure. The small and large bowel are of normal caliber, without wall thickening, or associated mass. There is no ascites, fluid collection, or pneumoperitoneum. The portal, splenic, and mesenteric veins are patent. The abdominal aorta is not enlarged and its main branches are patent. There is minimal atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta. There is no retroperitoneal, periportal, or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  PELVIS: The rectum and urinary bladder are normal. The prostate is minimally enlarged, with coarse calcifications. The seminal vesicles are normal. There is no pelvic free fluid or mass. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  MUSCULOSKELETAL: There are no lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions concerning for malignancy."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with severe RUQ abdominal pain, nausea, and a history of total gastrectomy with Roux-en-y reconstruction. Laboratory results revealed infection (elevated WBC and neutrophils), acute kidney injury (elevated BUN and creatinine), coagulopathy (elevated PT, INR, and PTT), and elevated lipase suggestive of pancreatitis.  The CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast showed a moderately distended gallbladder with indistinct and hazy walls, radiopaque gallstones in the neck of the gallbladder and cystic duct, trace pericholecystic free fluid, and no intra- or extrahepatic bile duct dilation.  The liver, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands appeared normal.  The findings suggest acute cholecystitis with gallstones as the primary cause of the patient's symptoms. The pancreatitis may be secondary to the gallstone obstruction or a separate process. The patient's coagulopathy and acute kidney injury likely reflect a systemic inflammatory response and dehydration.

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RUQ pain, nausea, and elevated lipase initially suggested pancreatitis. However, the CT scan reveals a distended gallbladder with gallstones in the neck and cystic duct, along with pericholecystic fluid. This points towards acute cholecystitis. The elevated WBC and neutrophils support the diagnosis of an inflammatory process. The abnormal coagulation studies are likely due to underlying liver dysfunction, possibly exacerbated by the cholecystitis. The hyponatremia, hypochloremia, and low bicarbonate could be due to dehydration or vomiting. The elevated alkaline phosphatase is consistent with biliary obstruction. The incidental lung nodule mentioned in the history should be followed up, but is unlikely to be related to the current presentation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Cholecystitis
2. Biliary Obstruction
3. Pancreatitis
4. Dehydration
5. Acute Kidney Injury

Treatment: The patient requires urgent surgical consultation for possible cholecystectomy.  Given the patient's coagulopathy (elevated PT/INR/PTT), this needs to be addressed prior to surgery. Vitamin K should be administered, and the underlying cause of the coagulopathy should be investigated further.  Intravenous fluids should be administered to correct dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.  Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started to cover for possible infection.  Pain management should be provided with intravenous analgesics.  The patient's renal function should be closely monitored, and nephrology consultation may be considered if the acute kidney injury worsens.  After the acute cholecystitis is addressed, follow-up imaging of the lung nodule should be arranged.
