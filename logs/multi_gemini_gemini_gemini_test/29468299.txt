HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ presents to the ED with a 2 day history of lower abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.  Over the last 24 hours, the pain localized to RLQ.   He has not experienced any fever, chills, shortness of breath, chest pain, dysuria, melena.    Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with pain localizing to the RLQ over the last 24 hours. This presentation suggests appendicitis.  Fever/chills are not always present in appendicitis. To assess for appendicitis, I need to evaluate for tenderness in the RLQ, guarding, and rebound tenderness.  A complete blood count can help assess for leukocytosis, which is often present in appendicitis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on RLQ tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign

ToolMessage:
"upon admission ___:  Vitals:Temp 98.3 HR 70 BP 123/82 RR 18 100% RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender in RLQ, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses. Rovsing's  positive. Obturator negative DRE: normal tone, no gross or occult blood Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with pain localizing to the RLQ over the last 24 hours. This presentation is highly suspicious for appendicitis. The physical exam findings of RLQ tenderness and a positive Rovsing's sign further increase the likelihood of appendicitis.  While the patient does not have rebound tenderness or guarding, these signs are not always present in early appendicitis. A CBC with differential would be helpful to assess for leukocytosis, which is often present in appendicitis.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is the gold standard for diagnosing appendicitis and should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential

ToolMessage:
"Here are the CBC (Complete Blood Count) with differential results from the available laboratory data:  Red Blood Cell related measurements: - Red Blood Cells: 5.8 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 17.1 g/dL - Hematocrit: 49.2% - MCV (Mean Corpuscular Volume): 85.0 fL - MCH (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin): 29.5 pg - MCHC (Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration): 34.8% - RDW (Red Cell Distribution Width): 12.7%  White Blood Cell related measurements: - White Blood Cells: 12.1 K/uL - Differential:   - Neutrophils: 81.0%   - Lymphocytes: 10.0%   - Monocytes: 7.3%   - Eosinophils: 0.9%   - Basophils: 0.8%  Platelet measurement: - Platelet Count: 262.0 K/uL  All components of a standard CBC with differential are available in the laboratory data."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings (RLQ tenderness, positive Rovsing's sign), and laboratory results (leukocytosis with neutrophilia) are highly suggestive of appendicitis.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is the gold standard for diagnosing appendicitis and should be ordered to confirm the diagnosis before surgical consultation.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired from the dome of the liver to the pubic symphysis after the uneventful administration of 130 mL of Omnipaque and oral contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were provided and reviewed. DLP: 272.81 mGy/cm.  FINDINGS: Abdomen: The imaged lung bases show no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The liver enhances homogeneously. The gallbladder is normal and there is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The spleen is normal in size. The pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast without hydronephrosis. The ureters are normal in course and caliber. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The stomach, large and small bowel are normal. Within the right lower quadrant, the appendix is noted to be fluid filled and dilated measuring 9 mm. The lack of intra-abdominal fat limits full evaluation for adjacent stranding, however, there is thickening of the right lateral conal fascia. There is no no adjacent fluid collection or free air. The abdominal aorta and major branches are unremarkable. The portal vein, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein are patent.  Pelvis: The bladder, rectum and prostate are normal.  Bones: There are no concerning lytic or blastic osseous lesions."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a 2-day history of lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with pain localizing to the RLQ over the last 24 hours.  Physical examination revealed RLQ tenderness and a positive Rovsing's sign.  The CBC showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, demonstrating a fluid-filled, dilated appendix measuring 9mm with thickening of the right lateral conal fascia.  These findings, in conjunction with the patient's history and physical exam, are consistent with acute appendicitis.
Action: done
