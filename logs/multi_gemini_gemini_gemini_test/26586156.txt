Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ s/p lap hiatal hernia repair with Hill gastropexy on ___ which was complicated by peritonitis for which she underwent a negative ex-lap on ___. She was noted to have cholangitis and then underwent ERCP with stone extraction and placement of a stent in the left hepatic duct.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's complex past medical history including recent abdominal surgery complicated by peritonitis and cholangitis, along with her current presentation of acute abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, it's crucial to rule out serious complications such as bowel obstruction, recurrent infection, or other post-surgical issues.  I need more information before determining the next steps.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation; abdominal exam including inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation assessing for tenderness, guarding, rebound, and distension; assessment of surgical scars for signs of infection or hernia recurrence.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's recent abdominal surgeries, history of peritonitis and cholangitis, combined with the current symptoms of acute abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting raise concerns for potential complications like bowel obstruction, recurrent infection, or other post-surgical issues. The physical exam findings suggest a relatively stable patient, but further investigation is needed.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia, suggesting an ongoing infectious process.  The elevated lactic acid indicates possible tissue hypoperfusion or sepsis.  The anemia is also concerning and could be related to chronic disease or acute blood loss.  Combined with the patient's history and physical exam, these findings raise the suspicion for a serious intra-abdominal process. Imaging is necessary to further evaluate.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were prepared.  CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Minimal atelectasis is identified at the lung bases. The imaged cardiac apex is within normal limits. The liver demonstrates homogeneous parenchymal enhancement without discrete lesion. The hepatic veins and portal venous system are grossly patent. The patient is status post recent ERCP with biliary stent placement in the common bile duct. The stent appears in expected position with extension of the proximal limb into the left intrahepatic duct. A tiny focus of central pneumobilia is likely related to recent procedure (5:18). Mild prominence of the central intrahepatic ducts remains. The gallbladder is markedly distended and has surrounding stranding/fluid and wall edema. In the setting of abdominal pain and leukocytosis, ____ is within the differential, however, followup ultrasound is recommended. The spleen and adrenal glands appear within normal limits. The pancreatic parenchyma appears normal. There is mild prominence of the pancreatic duct throughout its course, unchanged compared to prior examination. This could be evaluated by ___ non-emergently if clinically indicated. There is symmetric enhancement of the kidneys without suspicious focal lesion or hydronephrosis. Numerous subcentimeter hypodensities within both kidneys remain too small to characterize, though likely represent small cysts. Abdominal aorta and branch vessels demonstrate severe atherosclerotic calcifications, though are non-aneurysmal and grossly patent. Bi-iliac stent grafts are in expected position and are patent. The patient is status post recent ___ fundoplication secondary to a hiatal hernia. Post-surgical changes near the gastroesophageal junction appear within normal limits. No recurrent hiatal hernia is evident. Small bowel is normal without signs of obstruction or inflammation. No extraluminal free air is identified.  CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Rectum and colon are normal in caliber and configuration without evidence of obstruction or inflammation. The bladder contains a Foley catheter and a small amount of air. Uterus and adnexa are unremarkable. No pelvic fluid is identified.  BONES AND SOFT TISSUE: Small foci of air along the anterior abdominal wall are likely secondary to recent injections. Post-surgical appearance of the thoracolumbar spine is overall unchanged in compared to prior examination. No acute fracture or bone destructive lesion is identified."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan reveals a distended gallbladder with surrounding stranding and wall edema, raising suspicion for cholecystitis.  This, combined with the patient's clinical presentation, lab results showing leukocytosis and elevated lactic acid, and recent history of biliary stent placement, makes cholecystitis the most likely diagnosis. While the CT also notes mild prominence of the intrahepatic ducts and pancreatic duct, these findings are less concerning given the recent ERCP and absence of other signs of pancreatitis or cholangitis.  I have enough information to make a clinical reasoning and stop information gathering.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, leukocytosis, and elevated lactic acid, combined with a history of recent abdominal surgery, raised concerns for serious intra-abdominal pathology. The CT scan reveals a distended gallbladder with surrounding stranding and wall edema, suggestive of cholecystitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Cholecystitis
2. Biliary Stent Dysfunction/Obstruction
3. Post-operative Ileus
4. Pancreatitis
5. Small Bowel Obstruction

Treatment: Admit the patient for intravenous fluids, pain control, and broad-spectrum antibiotics covering gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria. Consult surgery for evaluation and likely cholecystectomy.  Monitor the patient's clinical status, including white blood cell count, and repeat imaging if necessary.  If there is evidence of biliary stent obstruction or dysfunction, an ERCP may be necessary.
