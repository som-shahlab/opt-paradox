HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ otherwise healthy male presents with 1-day history  of abdominal pain initially diffuse then localized to the RLQ.  Associated with nausea and significant vomiting. No fever,  chills, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia. Had BM and flatus today.  Recalls two similar episodes of pain over the summer and a  couple months ago which self-resolved.    Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: None


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain localized to the RLQ, nausea, and vomiting, raising suspicion for appendicitis.  The history of similar self-resolving episodes also raises the possibility of intermittent bowel obstruction or other recurrent abdominal issues.  A physical exam is necessary to evaluate for peritoneal signs and assess the location and severity of the pain.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on RLQ tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign, Murphy's sign,  rectal exam, vital signs including temperature

ToolMessage:
"Vital signs: Temp 97.9 HR 96 BP 155/72 RR 16 O2 100% RA  GEN: In no acute distress; non-toxic HEENT: No scleral icterus CV: RRR LUNGS: CTAB ABD: Soft, NT, ND, tender to palpation in RLQ, + rebound; no guarding; pos Rovsing's sign EXT: wwp, palpable pulses"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, positive Rovsing's sign, and rebound tenderness strongly suggests appendicitis.  The lack of fever and the history of self-resolving similar episodes could point to other diagnoses, but appendicitis remains the most likely.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for other potential causes of abdominal pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. IV Contrast: 130 mL Omnipaque. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: 384 mGy-cm  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is dilated up to 1.2 cm and there is fat stranding in the right lower quadrant adjacent to the appendix consistent with ____. No free air or fluid collections are identified in the right lower quadrant. (Series 2, image 51 through 56)  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The reproductive organs are unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding.  The patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and the CT scan confirming a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding solidify the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The history of previous self-resolved episodes may represent prior mild appendicitis that resolved spontaneously or other transient abdominal issues.  Given the current CT findings, surgical intervention is warranted.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Recurrent Abdominal Pain (likely prior mild appendicitis)
3. Early Appendiceal Abscess
4. Mesenteric Adenitis
5. Right Lower Quadrant Pain of Unknown Etiology

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment.  This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the severity of the inflammation and surgeon preference.  Pre-operative antibiotics should be administered to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole).  Post-operative care includes pain management, monitoring for complications (e.g., infection, abscess), and early ambulation.  The patient should be advised to follow up with their surgeon for wound check and further management.
