Thought: This patient presents with acute, severe abdominal pain radiating to the back, with a history of AAA. While vascular surgery has ruled out acute surgical intervention for the AAA, the increasing size of the AAA (from 3 cm to 3.8 cm) combined with her symptoms raises concern for potential complications like contained rupture or impending rupture.  Her elevated lipase, though not drastically high, could indicate pancreatitis, which can also cause severe abdominal pain.  Additionally, the newly discovered cholelithiasis could be contributing to her symptoms, although her pain doesn't perfectly fit the classic biliary colic presentation.  Her elevated creatinine and lactate are concerning and warrant further investigation to rule out other serious conditions. I need more information to determine the cause of her abdominal pain and rule out life-threatening conditions.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: This patient's presentation is complex. Her abdominal pain, elevated lipase, and cholelithiasis suggest possible pancreatitis or biliary pathology. However, her worsening renal function (elevated creatinine and BUN), elevated lactate, and high INR raise serious concerns. The elevated transaminases (ALT, AST, ALP) and bilirubin further complicate the picture, suggesting possible liver involvement.  The mild leukocytosis could be due to any of these processes.  Given her history of AAA and its slight increase in size, along with the persistent back pain, the possibility of a contained AAA rupture still needs to be considered, even if vascular surgery has deemed it not currently requiring surgical intervention.  Her anemia is also concerning and should be factored into the differential. I believe I have enough information to make a reasonable differential diagnosis and suggest a plan.
