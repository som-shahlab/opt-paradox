Thought: Given the patient's history of gallstones, epigastric pain radiating downwards, nausea, vomiting, elevated lipase, amylase, ALT, AST, and Alk phos, and ultrasound findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis, it's crucial to differentiate between acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or both.  The low blood glucose is concerning and needs further investigation. I need to understand the complete blood count (CBC) to assess for infection/leukocytosis and a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) to evaluate electrolyte imbalances and kidney function.  Additionally, I need to know the patient's age and the specific dates for context.
Action: laboratory tests

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show leukocytosis and neutrophilia, which suggest an inflammatory process or infection.  The elevated alkaline phosphatase, ALT, and AST, along with the ultrasound findings, further support the possibility of acute cholecystitis. The significantly elevated lipase from the outside hospital points towards pancreatitis. The low glucose, while improved from the initial presentation, is still a concern and could be related to pancreatitis or another underlying metabolic issue.  Given the patient's presentation and the available information, I believe I have enough information to make a differential diagnosis.
