InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with left flank pain, shortness of breath, and history of nephrolithiasis in the family. While some tests have been done, the underlying cause of his symptoms remains unclear.  The patient's worsening dyspnea, tachycardia, and new onset of paresthesias are concerning and suggest a possible systemic issue. I need to gather more information to understand the patient's respiratory status, potential cardiac involvement, and electrolyte balance, which could be contributing to his symptoms.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms of flank pain, shortness of breath, and paresthesias, combined with a family history of nephrolithiasis, initially suggested a possible renal issue, perhaps complicated by an electrolyte imbalance or a pulmonary embolism. The normal BMP, magnesium, phosphorus, and calcium levels, along with the previously negative D-dimer and CT scan, make these less likely. The patient's worsening dyspnea and new onset of paresthesias raise concern for a potential respiratory or neurological issue. An ABG was not available in the provided information, but given the patient's persistent dyspnea and history of hypoxia, it's crucial to assess their respiratory status.  The lack of an obvious cause for the patient's symptoms after initial workup warrants further investigation into other potential causes, including cardiac and neurological etiologies.
