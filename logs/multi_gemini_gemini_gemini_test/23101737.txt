HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Healthy ___ p/w abd pain. Pain started 8 hours ago. Located  mainly along his umbilicus and lower abdomen and does not  radiate. Denies fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting. Last BM  yesterday and formed, non-bloody. Came to the ED this morning  because the pain was increasing in severity. Last ate a fruit  yesterday evening.    Past Medical History: Denies   Social History: ___ Family History: no family history of colon cancer, Crohns, or UC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain of increasing severity. Given the location and lack of other symptoms, appendicitis is a primary differential. Other possibilities include gastroenteritis, constipation, or early diverticulitis. A physical exam is necessary to assess for peritoneal signs and localize the pain.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, McBurney's point palpation, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign, rectal exam

ToolMessage:
"Phx: 97.5 | 78 | 138/74 | 16 | 98 RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, TTP along umbilicus and lower midline  abdomen, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain of increasing severity. The physical exam reveals tenderness along the umbilicus and lower midline abdomen without rebound or guarding.  While the absence of rebound tenderness and guarding argues against appendicitis, it cannot be ruled out definitively.  The lack of fever, nausea, and vomiting also makes gastroenteritis less likely.  Constipation is possible, but the patient reports a bowel movement yesterday.  To further evaluate for appendicitis and other intra-abdominal pathology, imaging is warranted.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report that matches your request:  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  EXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 3.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 14.4 mGy (Body) DLP = 7.2 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 6.6 s, 52.1 cm; CTDIvol = 11.0 mGy (Body) DLP = 574.7 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 582 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. The left kidney is somewhat abnormal. It is subtly hypoenhancing in comparison to the right kidney. There is cortical scarring along the upper pole of the left kidney. Multiple subcentimeter cysts/cystic change is noted in the lower pole. These changes are somewhat nonspecific, and may reflect prior injury. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. An appendicolith is seen at the base of the appendix. The appendix itself is dilated, demonstrates mural edema, and is dilated, measuring up to 1.3 cm. There is adjacent fat stranding without discrete fluid collection or extraluminal air. These findings are compatible with acute uncomplicated ____.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate and seminal vesicles are normal.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with mural edema, an appendicolith, and periappendiceal fat stranding.  The patient requires surgical consultation for appendectomy.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with acute abdominal pain.  The physical exam was concerning for appendicitis, though not definitive. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with mural edema, an appendicolith, and periappendiceal fat stranding.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Constipation
3. Gastroenteritis
4. Mesenteric adenitis
5. Early Diverticulitis

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment for acute appendicitis. This can be performed laparoscopically or open, with laparoscopic appendectomy being the preferred approach in most cases.  The patient should be given intravenous fluids and antibiotics preoperatively.  Pain management should be provided with analgesics.  Post-operatively, the patient should be monitored for complications such as infection, bleeding, or abscess formation.
