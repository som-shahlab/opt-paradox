HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
The patient is a ___ y.o. man who developed epigastric pain 6 days ago. This pain gradually worsened over the following 2  days, and on the third day, he developed high fever (measured at ___ at home). These fevers persisted despite Tylenol. He had nausea but no vomiting and denied any change in bowel habits. He had decreased appetite but was able to continue taking liquids. On ___ he saw his PCP who started him on Bactrim for presumed UTI. He had no improvement in his symptoms and therefore presented to the ___ ED today.    Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: I need the patient's age, highest temperature measured, and the date he saw his PCP to understand the timeline and severity of his illness.  Additionally, social history details are important to assess risk factors.  I also need to know the location of the ED presentation.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam,  HEENT exam, lung exam, cardiovascular exam

ToolMessage:
"On admission  VS: 98.5  81  117/56  18  99%  Gen:NAD CV: RRR S1 S2 Lungs: CTA B/L Abd: soft, ND, TTP suprapubic and periumbilical region with palpable mass in that area, no rebound or guarding. Extr: WWP"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with epigastric pain that worsened over two days and was followed by high fever, nausea, and decreased appetite.  He was treated for a presumed UTI with no improvement.  His physical exam reveals tenderness and a palpable mass in the suprapubic and periumbilical region.  While the initial presentation suggested a possible UTI, the lack of improvement on Bactrim, the abdominal exam findings, and the persistent fever raise concern for other diagnoses, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or an abdominal abscess.  I need imaging to further evaluate the abdominal mass and rule out these possibilities.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"CT ABD & PELVIS W & W/O CONTRAST, ADDL SECTIONS (CT):  TECHNIQUE: CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed per department CTU protocol. Initial noncontrast imaging was performed followed by contrast enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis.  FINDINGS: The lung bases and cardiac apex are normal. Liver, spleen, pancreas, gallbladder and bilateral adrenals are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of renal calculi, hydronephrosis or renal masses. The ureters are normal without evidence of calculi or hydroureter. Abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. No free air is present. No retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is seen. The appendix is hyperemic, thick-walled, and dilated to 8-mm, with a large amount of adjacent phlegmonous stranding and surrounding complex fluid measuring up to 4 x 1.5 cm. An obstructing appendicolith is identified within the appendiceal lumen (___:27). No extraluminal air is identified. An adjacent loop of distal ileum demonstrates mural thickening (___:18) which is likely reactive to the adjacent inflammation centered within the appendix. The stomach, duodenum, proximal small bowel, and colon are normal. Within the pelvis, the distal ureters, bladder, prostate, and rectum are all unremarkable. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with epigastric pain, fever, nausea, and decreased appetite. He was initially treated for a presumed UTI, but his symptoms did not improve. Physical exam revealed tenderness and a palpable mass in the suprapubic and periumbilical region.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis with a dilated, hyperemic appendix, an appendicolith, and surrounding phlegmon. The adjacent ileal thickening is likely reactive.  The patient requires an appendectomy.

DiagnosisMessage:

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Appendiceal Abscess
3. Diverticulitis
4. Epiploic Appendagitis
5. Mesenteric Adenitis

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy. This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the severity of the inflammation and surgeon preference.  Pre-operatively, the patient should receive IV fluids, antibiotics with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage (e.g., Cefoxitin, or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole), and pain control. Post-operatively, the patient should continue antibiotics, receive pain management, and be monitored for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  The patient should be educated on wound care and follow-up.
