HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ who presents with 24 hour history of diffuse abdominal pain since ___, now with more focal RLQ pain x 24 hours. She endorses nausea, but has not vomited. Denies  fever/chills/changes in bowels. States that she hasn't had much to eat today due to her symptoms.   Of note, she is currently undergoing a work-up of RUE and RLE weakness, backpain, and headaches, and does not have a clear diagnosis at this point. Despite this, she has no limitations to her activities and is able to go about her usual daily activities. She has not had a headache in several weeks per her report. She is otherwise healthy.    Past Medical History: ___ PNA s/p 5days of azithromycin  acute on chronic L sided headaches,? migraines, most likely  tension HA (Dr. ___ L knee, heel pain back pain depression anxiety Vitamin B12 deficiency with paresthesias  PSH: none   Social History: ___ Family History: adopted, unaware of family history


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's presentation of RLQ abdominal pain, nausea, and decreased oral intake, appendicitis is high on the differential. However, other diagnoses such as ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, or even constipation need to be ruled out.  Her history of back pain, headaches, and extremity weakness is concerning, but without more information, it's unclear if it's related to her current abdominal pain. I need to gather more information through physical exam and lab tests before proceeding.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, and Rovsing's sign), pelvic exam

ToolMessage:
"Admission PHYSICAL EXAMINATION   Temp: 97.8 HR: 86 BP: 120/77 Resp: 16 O(2)Sat: 100 Constitutional: Comfortable HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic Oropharynx within normal limits Chest: Clear to auscultation Cardiovascular: Regular Rate and Rhythm Abdominal: Soft, + RLQ tenderness Extr/Back: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema Neuro: Speech fluent Psych: Normal mood ___: No petechiae"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The physical exam confirms RLQ tenderness, further increasing the suspicion for appendicitis.  The patient's vital signs are stable, and the rest of the physical exam is unremarkable.  Lab tests are needed to assess for signs of infection and inflammation, and to evaluate other potential causes of abdominal pain.  Imaging may be necessary to visualize the appendix and confirm the diagnosis.
Action: laboratory tests

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, nausea, and decreased oral intake. Physical exam reveals RLQ tenderness.  While her WBC is normal, the presence of many bacteria in the urine raises the possibility of a urinary tract infection, which could be contributing to her symptoms.  The slightly low hemoglobin/hematocrit is noted but not acutely concerning in this setting. The urine ketones are likely elevated due to decreased oral intake.  Given the concerning findings for a possible UTI, I will order a CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate for appendicitis and other possible causes of abdominal pain, as well as further assess the urinary tract.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 241 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is dilated to 10 mm in diameter, fluid filled with several fecaliths, and with hyperemia of the wall and at least. There is mild surrounding inflammatory stranding but no extraluminal air or drainable collection.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is trace free fluid in the pelvis. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Uterus is notable for several exophytic fibroids, the largest the fundus anteriorly measuring 2.5 x 2.3 x 2.9 cm LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  NOTIFICATION: Patient had been transferred to ___ Deaconess for treatment of ____ at time of interpretation."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, and decreased oral intake, along with RLQ tenderness on physical exam, initially raised suspicion for appendicitis.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with fecaliths, hyperemia, and surrounding inflammatory stranding.  The presence of many bacteria in the urine, while concerning for a UTI, is likely incidental in this case, as the CT does not show other signs of urinary tract infection. The patient's mild anemia is noted but not of immediate concern given the acute appendicitis. The elevated urine ketones are likely due to decreased oral intake. The uterine fibroids are also noted but likely incidental to the current presentation. The patient requires surgical intervention for her appendicitis.
