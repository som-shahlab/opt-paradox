Denies arthralgias or myalgias. Ten point review of  systems is otherwise negative.   Past Medical History: 1.  Left ventricular systolic dysfunction with ejection fraction ___ by echo and regional abnormalities as described.  There appears to be left ventricular dyssynchrony as well by echocardiogram, which is likely related to her left bundle  branch block.  Right heart catheterization in ___ showed a mean PCWP of 30, PA ___ with a mean of 41 and mean RA pressure of 15. 2.  Coronary artery disease as described, status post drug-eluting stent to left circumflex on ___.  There is residual 50% stenosis in the mid RCA with no significant disease in the left main or LAD. 3.  Diabetes mellitus. 4.  Hypertension.  She denies any significant orthostatic symptoms. 5.  Hypercholesterolemia. 6.  Hypothyroidism. 7.  GERD.      Social History: ___ Family History: She has two older brothers who have had myocardial infarctions,  but she cannot be more specific about their ages at that time or  the subsequent evaluation.  Another brother who is ___ years old,  had bypass surgery ___ years ago, followed by the need for a redo  CABG.  Ms. ___ mother died of a stroke at the age of ___  and her father died with diabetes mellitus at the age of ___.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with nausea, vomiting, and chills with elevated lipase and slightly low hematocrit.  The differential includes acute pancreatitis, gastroenteritis, cholecystitis, and other GI issues. Given her history of CAD, it's important to rule out cardiac causes.  More information is needed to narrow the differential diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show a slightly elevated glucose, likely due to her diabetes.  The low hemoglobin and hematocrit suggest mild anemia, which could be chronic or related to dehydration from vomiting.  The normal troponin makes a cardiac event less likely.  The elevated lipase points towards a pancreatic issue.  The patient's presentation and lack of other findings suggest acute pancreatitis as the most likely diagnosis.  A CRP and UA would be helpful to further evaluate for inflammation and infection, but I have enough information to make a reasonable conclusion.
