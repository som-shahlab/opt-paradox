Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with hx of anxiety, depression, ADHD, GERD, obesity presenting with epigastric pain.  Pt initially presented to urgent care on ___ with reports of intermittent, progressive abdominal pain x3 months. Pt noted onset of pain while in ___ in ___, and wondered if symptoms were related to altitude or new foods. She describes pain at that time as discomfort in the epigastrium twice weekly, often but not always postprandial. The day prior to  presentation, she had breakfast of bacon and eggs, and chicken ___ for dinner; she noted epigastric pain and nausea after her meal,  with nonbloody emesis. On ___, she vomited again, clear liquids. She describes pain as ___, sharp, epigastric, radiating to her back, worse with deep breaths.  She endorses a total of 6 drinks per week, generally ___ per night on the weekends.   At the time of urgent care evaluation, she endorsed persistent nausea, without fevers, chills, diaphoresis, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematuria, melena, hematochezia. She was ordered for stat labs, with plan for f/u with ultrasound if labs unrevealing.  Labs subsequently returned with ALT 685, AST 587, alk phos 196, Tbili 2.6, lipase 1660.   In the ___ ED: VSS Exam notable for: Abd: Soft, nondistended, tender to RUQ and epigastric region. Negative ___ sign  Labs notable for: WBC 7.5, Hb 13.7 ALT 671, AST 520, Alk phos 220, Tbili, 1.1, lipase 1126  Imaging: RUQ u/s:  1. Cholelithiasis with dilatation of the common bile duct up to 1.3 cm. Although no CBD stone was seen, this may suggest choledocholithiasis.  ERCP/MRCP may be obtained for further evaluation. 2. No evidence of acute cholecystitis. 3. Echogenic liver consistent with steatosis. Other forms of liver disease and more advanced liver disease including steatohepatitis or significant hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis cannot be excluded on this study.  Consults: None  Received: IVF  On arrival to the floor, pt denies abdominal pain, nausea.  ROS: 10 point review of system reviewed and negative except as otherwise described in HPI    Past Medical History: ADHD Obesity Depression   Social History: ___ Family History: Mother with DM, father in good health Sister in good health

Thought: The patient presents with epigastric pain radiating to the back, elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST), elevated total bilirubin, and elevated lipase.  The ultrasound shows cholelithiasis and a dilated common bile duct, raising suspicion for choledocholithiasis. While the patient's symptoms have improved, further investigation is needed to determine the cause of the initial pain and abnormal lab values. An MRCP is necessary to visualize the biliary tree and confirm or exclude choledocholithiasis.  Additionally, given the patient's alcohol consumption and significantly elevated liver enzymes, it's important to assess for other potential causes of liver injury.

"Here is the MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC) report:  EXAMINATION: MRCP:  TECHNIQUE: T1- and T2-weighted multiplanar images of the abdomen were acquired in a 1.5 T magnet. Intravenous contrast: Gadavist. Oral contrast: 1 cc of Gadavist mixed with 50 cc of water was administered for oral contrast.  FINDINGS: The study is markedly degraded by motion artifact.  Lower Thorax: No pleural effusion. Mild bronchial impaction noted in the left lower lobe which is nonspecific and could be better characterized with chest CT if clinically indicated.  Liver: Hepatic steatosis with a fat fraction of 24%. No focal suspicious hepatic lesions.  Biliary: There is a 4 mm calculus in the distal CBD with proximal bile duct dilatation with the CBD measuring up to 13 mm in diameter. Smaller calculi are noted in the mid to distal CBD. Gallstones but no features of cholecystitis. Mild intrahepatic bile duct dilatation. Phrygian cap.  Pancreas: The pancreatic parenchyma demonstrates normal enhancement. The pancreatic duct is not dilated. No peripancreatic edema/stranding. No complications of ____.  Spleen: Unremarkable  Adrenal Glands: Unremarkable  Kidneys: Unremarkable  Gastrointestinal Tract: No bowel obstruction  Lymph Nodes: Borderline portacaval lymph nodes measuring up to 13 mm diameter.  Vasculature: Major vasculature are patent.  Osseous and Soft Tissue Structures: No suspicious bony lesion  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the ___ ___ at 4:14 pm, 15 minutes after discovery of the findings."

Thought: The patient presented with epigastric pain, elevated liver enzymes, and elevated lipase. Initial ultrasound showed cholelithiasis and dilated common bile duct. The MRCP confirms choledocholithiasis, explaining the patient's symptoms and lab findings. The elevated liver enzymes are likely due to the biliary obstruction.  The patient's alcohol consumption and echogenic liver raise the possibility of underlying fatty liver disease, which could also contribute to elevated liver enzymes.  Given the confirmed choledocholithiasis, the next step would be endoscopic intervention for stone removal.
