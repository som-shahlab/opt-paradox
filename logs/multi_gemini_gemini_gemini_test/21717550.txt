HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
The patient's pain began at 1AM (___) in the epigastric region  and awoke him from sleep, with no relief from ibuprofen. He  described the pain as sharp, constant, a ___, and with no alleviating or aggravating factors. The pain became bad enough that he  presented to the ED that morning.    Past Medical History: None, per patient.   Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's acute epigastric pain that awoke him from sleep is concerning. The character of the pain (sharp, constant) and lack of relief with ibuprofen suggest a serious condition.  I need more information about the pain severity and other associated symptoms to narrow down the differential diagnosis. Social history is also important to assess risk factors.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation), assessment for peritoneal signs (guarding, rebound tenderness, rigidity)

ToolMessage:
"On admission:  Vitals: T 97.6, HR 95, BP 149/97, RR 16, PO2 100% RA, Pain ___ without meds, ___ with meds GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender to palpation esp. in RLQ, no rebound or guarding, no palpable masses Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's acute epigastric pain, now localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ), along with tenderness in the RLQ on palpation raises suspicion for appendicitis.  The absence of rebound tenderness and guarding lowers the likelihood, but does not rule it out.  Given the patient's presentation, I need to rule out other potential causes of RLQ pain such as a kidney stone or gynecological issues (if female).  A complete blood count (CBC) would help assess for infection/inflammation, and a urinalysis would help rule out a urinary tract infection or kidney stone.  Imaging is also necessary to visualize the appendix and surrounding structures.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, urinalysis

ToolMessage:
"I'll provide the results for the requested CBC with differential and urinalysis:  CBC with Differential: - White Blood Cells: 15.5 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 5.5 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 16.9 g/dL - Hematocrit: 48.9% - MCV: 89.0 fL - MCH: 30.7 pg - MCHC: 34.6% - RDW: 12.7% - Platelet Count: 302.0 K/uL - Differential:   - Neutrophils: 78.2%   - Lymphocytes: 17.3%   - Monocytes: 3.6%   - Eosinophils: 0.7%   - Basophils: 0.2%  Urinalysis: - Appearance: Clear - Color: Yellow - Specific Gravity: 1.019 - pH: 6.0 units - Protein: Negative - Glucose: Negative - Ketones: Negative - Blood: Negative - Leukocytes: Negative - Nitrite: Negative - Bilirubin: Negative - Urobilinogen: Negative  All requested tests are available in the laboratory results."

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's elevated white blood cell count (WBC) with a high neutrophil percentage, combined with RLQ pain, tenderness, and initial epigastric pain, strongly suggests appendicitis. The normal urinalysis makes a urinary tract infection or kidney stones less likely.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is now indicated to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis and evaluate for any complications like perforation or abscess.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST report:  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis without administration of IV contrast. Axial images were interpreted in conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats. DLP: 402 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:   ABDOMEN: The visualized heart is unremarkable. There is trace bibasilar dependent atelectasis. The lung bases are otherwise clear. No pleural or pericardial effusion is seen. The liver is normal without focal or diffuse abnormality. The gallbladder, intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts, pancreas, spleen and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. Two small splenules are incidentally noted. Bilateral kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly. Bilateral ureters are normal in course and caliber. The stomach is unremarkable. The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber. The appendix is dilated to 13 mm, is fluid filled, and has a hyperemic wall. There is no evidence of perforation or abscess. The adjacent cecum is unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes. The portal and intra-abdominal systemic vasculature are unremarkable. No abdominal wall hernia, pneumoperitoneum, or free abdominal fluid.  PELVIS: The bladder and terminal ureters are normal. Normal bilateral ureteral jets. The prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable. No pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy. No inguinal hernia or free pelvic fluid.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion concerning for malignancy."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with a hyperemic wall, measuring 13 mm. There is no evidence of perforation or abscess, which is good news.  The rest of the abdominal and pelvic structures appear normal.  With the clinical picture and imaging findings, I am confident in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with a hyperemic wall, measuring 13mm.  There is no evidence of perforation or abscess, which is good news.  The patient requires an appendectomy.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Right Lower Quadrant Pain (Unspecified)
4. Cecal Diverticulitis
5. Epiploic Appendagitis

Treatment:  The patient should be started on IV fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin, or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole).  A surgical consult should be obtained for a laparoscopic appendectomy.  Pain management should be provided with IV opioids as needed.  The patient should be kept NPO (nothing by mouth) in preparation for surgery.  Post-operatively, the patient should receive continued IV antibiotics and pain management.  The patient should be monitored for complications such as wound infection, abscess formation, and ileus.  The patient can be discharged home once they are tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, and pain is controlled with oral medications.  Follow-up with the surgeon should be arranged within 1-2 weeks.
