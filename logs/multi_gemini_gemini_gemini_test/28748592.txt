___ w/ hx of dual kidney/pancreas transplant ___, DMI, on  tacro, sirolimus, prednisone) and transplant-related  erythrocytosis who presents with abnormal labs and abdominal  pain. He is ___ speaking only, and history was obtained  through medical records and translator and in the presence of  two ___ officers.  Patient had been in ___ prior to representing to ___ on ___. The patient has had  recent history of dysuria and has reportedly been on Augmentin  while in ___ for presumed UTI, although was not on any  antibiotics while at ___. It appears he was not taking  his sirolimus as prescribed, as well. Over the last 4 days, he  has been feeling generally unwell, and developed lower right  quadrant abdominal pain with associated malaise and nausea. He  was seen by his PCP day of presentation and labs revealed  hyperkalemia to 5.4, Cr of 2.1 (baseline 1.7), amylase 300,  lipase 170. Given acute on chronic kidney injury and concern for  possible pancreatic rejection, the patient was sent to ___ for  further evaluation.     Initial VS in the ED: 98.0 79 142/94 18 96% RA. Initial labs  were notable for WBC 13.1 (N:82.4 L:11.7 M:4.3 E:1.0 Bas:0.6),  H/H: 19.7/64.2 (last time here 14.8/47.0), ___: 340 Lip: 86, Na  131, K 5.3, Cl 111, HCO3 9, BUN/Cr: 38/2.1, Ca: 12.3. CT  ABD/PELVIS w/o contrast was unrevealing. Patient was given 2mg  Morphine, 4mg Zofran, and 1 dose of zosyn and 1L D5W with 150mEq  NaHCO3. VS prior to transfer: 97.8 71 114/73 16 95%.     On the floor, of note, the patient continues to complain of RLQ  abdominal pain, dysuria, mild nausea, and occasional chills.  Also notes mild headache but denies visual changes (is  chronically blind in one eye).    Past Medical History: -Urinary retention   -bladder stone removal via cycstocopy in ___   -chronic metabolic acidosis   -legally blind in the let eye   -DM type 1 c/b retinopathy, nephropathy s/p kidney and pancreas  transplant in ___ at ___.   -Transplant-related erythrocytosis   -HLD   -HTN   -GERD   -L.

Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, acute on chronic kidney injury, and elevated amylase and lipase. The differential includes pancreatitis, transplant rejection, infection (given history of recent UTI), or other intra-abdominal pathology.  Given the complexity of the case and the patient's immunosuppressed state, a thorough evaluation is needed. I need to understand the character of the abdominal pain better and assess for peritoneal signs. Additionally, the patient's recent non-compliance with sirolimus warrants further investigation into the cause.  A urinalysis is needed to evaluate for persistent UTI.  Further laboratory tests are also needed to assess the patient's electrolyte abnormalities and renal function, as well as markers of inflammation and infection.

Thought: The patient continues to have tenderness in the right and left lower quadrants with minimal guarding, but no rebound tenderness.  The lack of rebound tenderness argues against peritonitis.  The elevated amylase and lipase raise concern for pancreatitis, although the degree of elevation is not particularly high.  The patient's history of recent possible UTI, dysuria, and elevated WBC count suggest a possible infectious etiology. The acute kidney injury could be related to dehydration, infection, medication toxicity (including sirolimus or antibiotics), or rejection.  The patient's non-compliance with sirolimus is a significant concern and needs to be addressed.  I will order laboratory tests to assess renal function, electrolyte abnormalities, inflammatory markers, and evaluate for infection, including a repeat urinalysis and urine culture.  I will also order a lipase and amylase to trend those values.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's laboratory results show persistent leukocytosis, elevated amylase, and acute kidney injury. The urinalysis shows hazy urine with proteinuria and leukocytes, suggestive of a urinary tract infection.  The sirolimus and tacrolimus levels are within therapeutic range. The elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit are consistent with the patient's history of transplant-related erythrocytosis.  While the patient's abdominal pain is concerning for rejection, the lack of rebound tenderness and the urinalysis findings point towards a UTI as a more likely cause of his current symptoms. The elevated amylase could be due to pancreatitis, but the lipase is normal, making this less likely.  Given the patient's complex medical history, immunosuppressed state, and recent possible UTI, I believe the most likely diagnosis is pyelonephritis with associated acute kidney injury.  The elevated amylase may be unrelated to the current presentation. I will order imaging of the kidneys and urinary tract to evaluate for pyelonephritis and other possible causes of the abdominal pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast is not available. While there is a CT abdomen and pelvis study in the available list, it was specifically performed without contrast due to acute kidney injury."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with abdominal pain, fever, leukocytosis, and elevated amylase raised concerns for several diagnoses, including pancreatitis, transplant rejection, and infection. The initial CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast was unrevealing.  The laboratory results show persistent leukocytosis, elevated amylase, and acute kidney injury. The urinalysis is suggestive of a urinary tract infection. The sirolimus and tacrolimus levels are within therapeutic range.  Given the patient's immunosuppressed state and the urinalysis findings, pyelonephritis is high on the differential.  While a CT with contrast would be ideal to evaluate for pyelonephritis, it is contraindicated due to the acute kidney injury.  Given the available information, I believe the most likely diagnosis is pyelonephritis with associated acute kidney injury.  The elevated amylase may be unrelated to the current presentation, possibly due to dehydration or another cause.  I would recommend starting the patient on broad-spectrum antibiotics for the presumed pyelonephritis and closely monitoring his renal function.  Further investigation into the cause of the elevated amylase can be pursued once the patient is stabilized and the acute kidney injury has resolved.
