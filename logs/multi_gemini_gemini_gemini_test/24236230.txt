InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is presenting with RUQ pain, suggestive of biliary pathology. The elevated lipase, dilated CBD, and GB edema raise suspicion for gallstone pancreatitis. The dark urine suggests possible biliary obstruction. I need to gather more information to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show significantly elevated ALT and AST, suggesting hepatocellular injury. While the lipase is currently normal, the prior elevation and the patient's symptoms point towards a biliary etiology. The normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase do not rule out gallstone pancreatitis or other biliary pathology.  Given the history and lab findings, I believe the patient has gallstone pancreatitis.  No further information is needed.
