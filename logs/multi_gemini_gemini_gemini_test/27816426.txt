Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with a history of kidney/pancreas transplant in ___ and more recently status post expiratory laparotomy and conversion of her loop duodenojejunostomy to a Roux-en-Y for perforated ulcer on the transplant duodenum in ___, who now presents with persistent nausea and vomiting for the past 12 hours.  Her most recent postoperative course was complicated by a persistent fistula from the transplant duodenum, which has been drained by  a pigtail drain up until yesterday, when she presented for a drain study.  Her study showed that she had a relatively mature  fistula tract and a new straight drain was placed more proximally in the tract.  She was seen in clinic yesterday and appeared to be  doing well.  However, she woke up this morning and had multiple episodes of small amounts of bilious emesis.  She is not able to taking any p.o. today, although she has been getting her TPN since her surgery to supplement her nutrition as well as  allowing for ongoing p.o. intake.  She denies any abdominal pain.  She  has not had any recorded fevers today, and although she has not passed gas today, she her last bowel movement was yesterday.   She denies any urinary symptoms, lightheadedness, dizziness.  She reports that nothing has been draining out of her new drain  since her procedure yesterday.  ROS: (+) per HPI (-) Denies pain, fevers chills, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue/malaise/lethargy, changes in appetite, trouble  with sleep, pruritis, jaundice, rashes, bleeding, easy bruising, headache, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, weakness, paresthesias, hematemesis, bloating, cramping, melena, BRBPR, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, edema,  urinary frequency, urgency    Past Medical History: Hypertension, Type 1 diabetes c/b gastroparesis, autonomic  neuropathy, 3) CKD s/p combined kidney/pancreas transplant ___    Migraine head aches, L-eye blindness, Bilateral cataract  surgery, Anemia, was receiving Aranesp ___  tear after repeated vomiting in ___, Depression   .

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's recent history of duodenal surgery, including a perforated ulcer and persistent fistula, raises concerns about potential complications such as obstruction, recurrence of the fistula, or a new anastomotic leak. The bilious emesis suggests a possible proximal obstruction. The lack of drainage from the recently placed drain is also concerning and could indicate blockage or displacement.  Given her complex medical history, including a kidney/pancreas transplant and diabetes, it's important to assess her fluid and electrolyte balance and evaluate for any signs of infection or rejection.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show a high lipase, which in combination with her nausea, vomiting, and history of duodenal surgery, raises concern for a pancreatic or duodenal issue.  Her low hemoglobin and hematocrit suggest anemia, which could be chronic or related to recent blood loss.  The elevated BUN and low bicarbonate may indicate dehydration.  The low magnesium needs to be addressed.  An abdominal CT scan would be helpful to visualize the duodenum and surrounding structures to evaluate for obstruction, leak, or other complications.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast is not available among the provided imaging studies. The available studies include a chest X-ray and a CT Abdomen and Pelvis without contrast."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's persistent nausea and vomiting, bilious emesis, history of duodenal surgery and fistula, lack of drain output, and now concerning lab values (high lipase, low hemoglobin/hematocrit, elevated BUN, low bicarbonate, and low magnesium), I am concerned about a possible duodenal obstruction, recurrence of the fistula, or a new anastomotic leak.  While a CT with contrast would be ideal, the CT without contrast may still provide valuable information about the integrity of the surgical site and surrounding structures.  I will review the available CT scan and chest x-ray.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis without contrast, Chest X-ray

ToolMessage:
"Both requested imaging studies are available. Here's the full report for the CT Abdomen and Pelvis without contrast:  CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST (CT): EXAMINATION: CT abdomen/pelvis  TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired without intravenous contrast. Non-contrast scan has several limitations in detecting vascular and parenchymal organ abnormalities, including tumor detection. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Acquisition sequence:     1) Spiral Acquisition 5.7 s, 44.6 cm; CTDIvol = 8.1 mGy (Body) DLP = 362.8 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 363 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:   LOWER CHEST: New small right and trace left pleural effusions with adjacent dependent atelectasis, interlobular septal thickening, and ground-glass opacities. Trace pericardial fluid is within physiologic limits. Severe mitral annulus calcification.  ABDOMEN:   HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogeneous attenuation throughout. Allowing for differences in measurement technique, a 2.7 cm hepatic cyst in segment II is unchanged. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is surgically absent.  PANCREAS: The native pancreas is unremarkable, without evidence of focal lesions within the limitations of an unenhanced scan. There is no pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. The right lower quadrant transplant pancreas demonstrates increased adjacent fat stranding with adjacent lateral conal fascia thickening. No pancreatic ductal dilatation is present. The pre-existing adjacent small peripancreatic fluid collection is not appreciably changed measuring approximately 12 mm (series 2, image 55).  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The native kidneys are atrophic. A left lower lobe quadrant renal transplant appears unremarkable in morphology with no focal lesions or nephrolithiasis within limitations of this noncontrast examination. A prominent extrarenal pelvis morphology is minimally changed. There is no hydronephrosis. There is no nephrolithiasis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber and wall thickness throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is not visualized. Nonspecific presacral fat stranding is unchanged. No free air or bowel obstruction.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. Small volume free pelvic fluid is noted (02:59). A new percutaneous drainage catheter terminates in the mid pelvis with small adjacent locules of gas likely from recent procedure (02:57).  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: There is hyperattenuating material within the endometrium, new in the interval, potentially reflective of contrast material and is not compatible with blood products. The uterus is otherwise anteverted, but unremarkable. A 2.9 cm simple appearing right adnexal cyst is unchanged. Left adnexa is unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Severe and diffuse atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Proximal right femoral hardware is noted without evidence of loosening. Chronic, healed right inferior pubic ramus fracture is again noted.  SOFT TISSUES: Postsurgical changes in the anterior abdominal wall appears similar to the prior examination.  NOTIFICATION: The updated impressions were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 8:57 pm."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan shows new small pleural effusions and dependent atelectasis, which could be related to her recent surgery or a developing pneumonia.  The transplant pancreas shows increased adjacent fat stranding, which could indicate inflammation or rejection.  The report also notes a new percutaneous drainage catheter in the mid-pelvis with small adjacent locules of gas, likely from the recent drain placement.  Importantly, there is no evidence of free air or bowel obstruction.  However, the lack of contrast limits the ability to fully assess for a leak or other subtle findings. Given the patient's persistent symptoms and concerning findings, I would recommend a CT with contrast to better evaluate the surgical site and surrounding structures.

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast is not available in the provided list. The available studies include a chest x-ray and a CT Abdomen and Pelvis without contrast, but not with contrast."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's persistent nausea, vomiting, and bilious emesis, combined with the history of duodenal surgery, fistula, and lack of drain output, raise strong suspicion for a postoperative complication such as obstruction, leak, or recurrent fistula. The lab findings of elevated lipase, low hemoglobin/hematocrit, elevated BUN, low bicarbonate, and low magnesium further support this concern.  While the non-contrast CT did not show free air or obstruction, the lack of contrast limits its sensitivity for detecting subtle leaks or other abnormalities.  Given the patient's clinical picture and the limitations of the available imaging, I would proceed with surgical consultation for further evaluation and management.  Even without a CT with contrast, the clinical picture is concerning enough to warrant surgical evaluation.
