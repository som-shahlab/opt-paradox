HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ p/w 35hrs of sudden-onset abdominal pain in the RLQ. Reports that since yesterday, he has had persistent RLQ pain, non-radiating, worse when standing and walking. No fevers at home, but does endorse chills, nausea and one episode of emesis in the ED. Prior to the onset of pain, he had diarrhea, which  has since resolved. He last ate at 4pm yesterday, and has been  taking advil for pain, last taken the night prior to admission.    Past Medical History: None. Some work-up performed for incidentally noted elevation in total bilirubin  PSH: None   Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain in the RLQ with symptoms suggestive of appendicitis.  Given the patient's presentation, I need to gather more information to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign, rebound tenderness, abdominal guarding,  vital signs including temperature

ToolMessage:
"VS: 98 70 125/89 16 100% RA Gen: NAD CV: RRR, no M/R/G Resp: No respiratory distress, CTAB Abd: Soft, non-distended. Tender in the RLQ, (+)rebound, no guarding Ext: WWP"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute RLQ abdominal pain, nausea, emesis, and chills. While the diarrhea has resolved, it may be relevant to the current presentation.  Physical exam findings indicate tenderness in the RLQ with rebound tenderness, further increasing the suspicion for appendicitis.  Laboratory tests are needed to assess for signs of infection and inflammation and to evaluate other potential causes of abdominal pain.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, urinalysis, lipase

ToolMessage:
"I'll help you organize the results for the requested tests:  CBC with differential: - White Blood Cells: 10.9 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 4.95 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 15.2 g/dL - Hematocrit: 43.4% - MCV: 88.0 fL - MCH: 30.7 pg - MCHC: 35.0 g/dL - RDW: 12.5% - Platelet Count: 179.0 K/uL - Neutrophils: 69.6% - Lymphocytes: 21.3% - Monocytes: 8.2% - Eosinophils: 0.3% - Basophils: 0.3% - Immature Granulocytes: 0.3%  CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel): - Sodium: 137.0 mEq/L - Potassium: 5.4 mEq/L - Chloride: 102.0 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 25.0 mEq/L - Glucose: 87.0 mg/dL - Urea Nitrogen: 15.0 mg/dL - Creatinine: 1.1 mg/dL - Albumin: 4.8 g/dL - Total Bilirubin: 2.5 mg/dL - Alkaline Phosphatase: 73.0 IU/L - AST: 35.0 IU/L - ALT: 20.0 IU/L  Urinalysis: Results not available in the provided data  Lipase: 33.0 IU/L"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including RLQ pain, rebound tenderness,  nausea, vomiting, chills, and leukocytosis, strongly suggests appendicitis.  The elevated total bilirubin is a known incidental finding and likely unrelated to the current presentation.  While the potassium is slightly elevated, it is not concerning in the acute setting.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is needed to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis and evaluate for any complications.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. No oral contrast was administered.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 497 mGy-cm. IV Contrast: 130 mL Omnipaque  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Lung bases are clear.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is unremarkable.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. No hydronephrosis.  GASTROINTESTINAL: Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness and enhancement throughout. Colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is slightly dilated in size to approximately 7 mm (previously 4 mm), with surrounding inflammatory stranding and mild hyperemia (601b:36, 602b:20). Findings are compatible with ____. No drainable fluid collection or free peritoneal air. There is no evidence of mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  RETROPERITONEUM: There is no evidence of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is no calcium burden in the abdominal aorta and great abdominal arteries.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Reproductive organs are within normal limits.  BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions. Incidentally noted is left L5 spondylolysis (602b:42). Abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  NOTIFICATION: The above findings were communicated via telephone by Dr. ___ to Dr. ___ at 12:58 on ___."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, laboratory results, and CT imaging confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. The CT scan shows a dilated appendix with surrounding inflammatory stranding and hyperemia.  I have enough information to make a diagnosis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, chills, and leukocytosis, combined with physical exam findings of RLQ tenderness and rebound tenderness, pointed towards appendicitis. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, showing a dilated appendix with surrounding inflammatory stranding and hyperemia.  The incidental findings of elevated bilirubin and L5 spondylolysis are not relevant to the current presentation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Right Lower Lobe Pneumonia
4. Ovarian Cyst (if female)
5. Ureterolithiasis

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy. This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the severity of the inflammation and surgeon preference.  Preoperatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin, or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole).  Postoperatively, the patient should receive pain management, continue antibiotics as indicated, and be monitored for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  The patient should be advised to follow up with their surgeon for wound care and further management.
