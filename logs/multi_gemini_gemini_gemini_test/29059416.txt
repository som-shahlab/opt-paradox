HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
The patient is a ___ y/o man with a ___ year h/o nephrolithiasis  who presents from ___ for evaluation of ___ right flank  pain of 1 month duration. The patient reports that he typically  gets kidney stones once or twice a year. Most recently, he had a  left-sided kidney stone 1 month ago which resolved after 4 days  with the administration of 4 daily "pills". He says that upon  the resolution of the kidney stone pain, he began to experience  a right-sided flank pain that he describes as more constant and  burning in nature when compared to the kidney stone pain. He  notes the onset of nausea but denies vomiting. He says that he  has had diminished appetite during this time and has lost 15  pounds in weight. He notes ___ days of loose stool, but denies  the presence of blood. The flank pain has been getting worse on  a daily basis.  . On ROS, he denies fever, chills, rash, CP, cough, SOB, dysuria.

He  arrived to the ___ on ___ by airplane to stay with his  children in ___ and seek medical care for this new,  unresolving pain.  Review of systems:   (+) Per HPI   (-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or  gain. Denies headache, sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or  congestion. Denied cough, shortness of breath. Denied chest pain  or tightness, palpitations. Denied vomiting and constipation. No  recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria. Denied  arthralgias or myalgias.    Past Medical History: - s/p bilateral rotator cuff repair, ___ years ago. - DM2; ___ yrs, poorly controlled, last HbA1C 10.9 (___). - HTN.  - Depression (laid off from work ___ years ago and has been  unemployed and collecting SSI; denies SI/ HI.)    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother died of leukemia (?blood cancer) at ___; father died in  drowning accident. Strong history of DM2 and HTN among family  members. His two sisters died of diabetes at ___ and ___.

Thought: The patient's presentation of unilateral flank pain, weight loss, and change in bowel habits raises concern for several potential diagnoses, including recurrent nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis, or even a malignancy.  Given his history of nephrolithiasis, it's important to investigate whether this is another stone or a different process.  His diabetes and recent travel history also add complexity to the case. I need more information to narrow down the possibilities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The urinalysis showing large blood with elevated glucose suggests possible diabetic nephropathy, kidney stones, or infection.  The normal WBC count argues against infection, but a urine culture is still pending and could change this assessment.  The patient's history of recurrent kidney stones makes this a strong possibility. Imaging is needed to visualize the kidneys and urinary tract. I will also request the HbA1c, ESR, and CRP results since they are still pending.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast, KUB (kidney, ureter, bladder) x-ray

ToolMessage:
"From the available studies, I can provide the CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast report:  CT ABDOMEN W/O CONTRAST (CT): TECHNIQUE: Contiguous helical acquisition through the abdomen and pelvis was performed without intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were created at the workstation.  CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There is bibasilar atelectasis. The heart is mildly enlarged. The liver, spleen, gallbladder, adrenal glands, pancreas, and bowel are normal in their appearance. The right kidney is normal in appearance. There is a stable-appearing 9-mm renal calculus located within the lower pole of the left kidney which is nonobstructing in nature. Also noted is a nonobstructing punctate calculus within the mid pole of the left kidney. There is an external pelvis on the left which is stable in appearance. The ureter is normal in appearance without evidence of dilatation. There is no perinephric fluid identified. There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen. The osseous structures are intact with degenerative changes of the spine.  CT PELVIS: There are no pelvic masses or lymphadenopathy identified. The appendix is normal in appearance and is best visualized on series 2, image 65 through 69. The visualized bowel is normal. There are calcifications within the prostate gland. Numerous vascular calcifications are identified. No bladder calculi are noted. The osseous structures are intact with degenerative changes of the spine identified.  The KUB x-ray is not available in the list of available imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan reveals a non-obstructing 9mm stone in the lower pole of the left kidney and a punctate stone in the mid-pole of the left kidney.  These findings, combined with the patient's history of recurrent nephrolithiasis and the urinalysis results, strongly suggest that the current right flank pain is not due to a kidney stone. The absence of hydronephrosis or perinephric stranding on the CT further supports this.  The patient's weight loss, change in bowel habits, and worsening pain raise concern for other pathologies, such as a malignancy or inflammatory process. While the CT scan did not reveal any obvious masses, further investigation is warranted. I will request the pending HbA1c, ESR, and CRP results to assess for inflammation or other systemic issues.  If these are unremarkable, I would consider a referral to gastroenterology for evaluation of the GI symptoms and weight loss.

Thought: The CT scan reveals a non-obstructing 9mm stone in the lower pole of the left kidney and a punctate stone in the mid-pole, consistent with his history of nephrolithiasis.  Importantly, the right kidney is reported as normal in appearance, and there is no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid. This makes a right-sided kidney stone unlikely as the cause of his current pain.  The patient's persistent right flank pain, weight loss, and change in bowel habits despite a normal right kidney on CT raise concern for other diagnoses.  Given his age and risk factors (diabetes, smoking history), malignancy needs to be considered.  The lack of fever and normal WBC count make infection less likely, but the urine culture is still pending.  His report of blurry vision and chronic left leg pain could be related to his poorly controlled diabetes.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Non-obstructing nephrolithiasis (left side)
2. Undetermined cause of right flank pain (needs further investigation - consider malignancy, retroperitoneal pathology)
3. Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 2
4. Diabetic neuropathy (possible cause of leg pain and blurry vision)
5. Depression

Treatment:
1. **Nephrolithiasis:**  Since the left-sided stones are non-obstructing and his pain is on the right side, no specific intervention is needed for the stones at this time.  Encourage hydration.  Strain urine to catch any passed stones for analysis.
2. **Right flank pain:**  Further investigation is crucial.  Order a urine cytology to evaluate for malignancy.  Consider abdominal MRI or ultrasound to evaluate the retroperitoneum and other structures not well visualized on the non-contrast CT.  Consultation with urology and potentially gastroenterology may be warranted.
3. **Diabetes Management:**  Optimize diabetes control.  Review current medications and adjust as needed.  Reinforce lifestyle modifications including diet, exercise, and glucose monitoring.  Referral to a diabetes educator or endocrinologist may be beneficial.
4. **Diabetic Neuropathy:**  Assess for peripheral neuropathy with a thorough neurological exam.  Consider nerve conduction studies if indicated.  Treatment options include pain management with medications such as gabapentin or pregabalin.
5. **Depression:**  Continue to monitor for symptoms of depression.  Consider therapy and/or medication if indicated.
