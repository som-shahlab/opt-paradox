HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This patient is a ___ year old female who complains of Abd pain. This patient developed abdominal pain approximately 36 hours ago which was initially generalized and midline and has migrated to the right lower quadrant. She has had some vomiting and low-grade fever. The pain is unchanged with Tylenol. She does not have any past surgical history. Her last menstrual period was 3 weeks ago. Her last bowel movement was yesterday. She has no urinary tract symptoms. She has no gynecologic symptoms. She has no back pain.    Past Medical History: PMH: HTN  Past Surgical History: left foot surgery (no problems with bleeding or anesthesia)    Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with acute abdominal pain migrating to the RLQ, vomiting, and low-grade fever. These symptoms are concerning for appendicitis.  I need to gather more information to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities like ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy, or kidney stones.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign), pelvic exam

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain localized to the RLQ, fever, and tachycardia. The physical exam reveals tenderness in the RLQ. These findings are highly suggestive of appendicitis.  While other diagnoses like ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy, or kidney stones are possible, the constellation of symptoms and signs points towards appendicitis.  I have enough information to recommend further management.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian cyst
3. Ectopic pregnancy
4. Kidney stones
5. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

Treatment:
1. Obtain a urine pregnancy test.
2. Order a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast to evaluate for appendicitis.
3. If the CT scan confirms appendicitis, consult surgery for a laparoscopic appendectomy.
4. Start IV fluids for hydration.
5. Administer analgesics (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone) for pain control.
6. Administer antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) for nausea and vomiting.
7. If the diagnosis is uncertain or if the patient is not a surgical candidate, consider a short period of observation with serial abdominal exams and repeat imaging.
8. Administer pre-operative antibiotics (e.g., Cefoxitin or Cefazolin plus Metronidazole) if surgery is planned.
9. Post-operative care should include pain management, wound care, and monitoring for complications such as infection or abscess formation.
