HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ M with c/o periumbilical abdominal pain, n/v/diarrhea  starting at 5PM last night - pain radiated to RLQ.  He has never had this pain before. Nothing makes better, worse with movement and pressure.      Past Medical History: PMH: Hyperchol, torn meniscus  PSH: knee arthroscopy    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. This presentation is concerning for appendicitis.  However, other differentials such as mesenteric adenitis, gastroenteritis, or even a hernia should be considered. I need to gather more information through physical examination to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign, rebound tenderness, abdominal guarding, bowel sounds assessment

ToolMessage:
"On Admission:  98 87 157/85 14 100%   AAOX3 NAD RRR CTAB soft, RLQ very tender to mild palpation, no diffuse guarding or rebound rectal - guaiac neg, no masses no edema, extrem warm"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and RLQ tenderness concerning for appendicitis.  The negative rectal exam with no masses or edema is reassuring but doesn't rule out appendicitis.  Given the patient's symptoms and physical exam findings, I suspect appendicitis. To confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities, I need imaging.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast study. Here is the full report:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Multidetector helical CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained after the administration of oral contrast and 130 mL IV Optiray contrast. Axial, coronal, and sagittal reformations were prepared.  FINDINGS: Within the imaged portions of the lung bases, there is mild bilateral dependent atelectasis. Within the abdomen, the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, and adrenal glands appear unremarkable. Loops of small and large bowel are of normal size and caliber. Within the pelvis, the appendix is dilated measuring up to 1 cm in diameter (300B:26, 2:71). There is mild hyperemia of the wall and surrounding inflammatory fat stranding. No free air or evidence of abscess formation is seen. No free fluid is noted. Distal loops of large bowel and rectum are of normal size and caliber. The bladder, distal ureters and prostate gland are unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen.  BONE WINDOWS: No concerning osseous lesion is seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with acute abdominal pain migrating from the periumbilical region to the RLQ, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed RLQ tenderness. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with hyperemia of the wall and surrounding inflammatory fat stranding.  No abscess or free fluid is noted, suggesting uncomplicated acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, combined with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and RLQ tenderness, strongly suggested appendicitis. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, revealing a dilated appendix with hyperemia and surrounding inflammatory fat stranding.  This confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Gastroenteritis
4. Right ureteral calculus
5. Epiploic appendagitis

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy.  This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the severity of the inflammation and surgeon preference.  Preoperatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids for rehydration and antibiotics with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage (e.g., Cefoxitin, or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole).  Postoperatively, the patient should receive pain management, continue antibiotics until afebrile and have a normal white blood cell count, and gradually advance their diet as tolerated.  The patient should be monitored for complications such as surgical site infection, abscess formation, or peritonitis.
