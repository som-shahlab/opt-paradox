InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, with a concerning pancreatic head mass found on CT at the transferring facility. Given the patient's history of alcohol abuse, elevated liver enzymes, and acute intoxication on presentation, it's crucial to assess for other potential causes of his symptoms and gather baseline data before considering further interventions.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show elevated AST/ALT and lipase, consistent with the suspected pancreatic pathology.  The thrombocytopenia is concerning and warrants further investigation, especially given the patient's history of alcohol abuse.  While the current blood alcohol level is unavailable, a urine toxicology screen could offer additional insights into recent substance use.  The patient's presentation and imaging findings suggest a likely diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, although other etiologies must be considered.  Further investigation with imaging and possible biopsy will be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and stage the disease.
