HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ M presents with approximately 48 hours of abdominal pain.   The pain was initially epigastric and dull, but worsened (___) became sharp and migrated to the RLQ.  He has had nausea, but no vomiting.  He notes anorexia, and has not eaten in 48 hours.  He had symptoms of a gastrointestinal virus one week ago.  Denies fever, chills, diarrhea, previous episodes of similar pain.  ROS:   (+) per HPI   (-) Denies fevers chills, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue/malaise/lethargy, changes in appetite, trouble with sleep, vomiting, hematemesis, bloating, cramping, melena, BRBPR, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, edema,  urinary frequency, urgency   Past Medical History: None  PSH: None   Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating from epigastric to RLQ, concerning for appendicitis.  The anorexia, nausea, and lack of vomiting further support this.  However, the recent GI illness could be a confounding factor. I need more information to assess the severity of the pain, look for peritoneal signs, and evaluate for other potential causes.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign),  assess for dehydration

ToolMessage:
"ADMISSION   97.2 F  71    115/63   14   98% RA GEN: A&O, NAD   HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist   CV: RRR, No M/G/R   PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R   ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender to light percussion in RLQ, + guarding, + ROvsiing sign, no palpable masses   Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, guarding, positive Rovsing's sign, and tenderness to percussion in the RLQ strongly suggests appendicitis.  The absence of fever doesn't rule it out, as early appendicitis may not present with fever.  Given the concerning physical exam findings, I would proceed with imaging to confirm the diagnosis before considering surgical intervention.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast matches the available CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT): TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired from the lung bases through the proximal thighs following administration of both intravenous and oral contrast. Multiplanar reformations were performed. PELVIS CT: The bladder is normal in appearance. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are seen in the pelvis. BONE WINDOW: The imaged osseous structures are unremarkable."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings (RLQ pain, guarding, positive Rovsing's sign, tenderness to percussion), and the presence of free fluid in the pelvis on CT scan strongly suggest appendicitis. While the report doesn't explicitly describe an inflamed appendix, the free fluid is a significant finding and concerning for a perforated appendix.  I have enough information to recommend surgical consultation.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including migration of pain from epigastric to RLQ, anorexia, nausea, RLQ tenderness, guarding, positive Rovsing's sign, and the presence of free fluid in the pelvis on CT, strongly points towards acute appendicitis. While the CT report doesn't explicitly mention appendicitis, the free fluid is a significant finding and, combined with the clinical picture, makes appendicitis the most likely diagnosis.  Other diagnoses like mesenteric adenitis or ovarian pathology (if female) are less likely given the constellation of findings.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Ovarian Cyst/Torsion (if female - gender not specified)
4. Right ureteral calculus
5. Early Diverticulitis

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for appendectomy.  Administer IV fluids for hydration.  Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics with anaerobic coverage (e.g., Piperacillin/Tazobactam or Cefoxitin plus Metronidazole) to prevent post-operative infection and treat potential perforation.  Provide pain management with IV opioids (e.g., Morphine or Hydromorphone).  NPO status until surgical evaluation.
