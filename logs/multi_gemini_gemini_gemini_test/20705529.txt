HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ female who complains of RLQ pain for the past month  which acutely worsened three days ago. She was previously  started on prilosec for several weeks ago for these symptoms.   For the past three days she also reports decreased oral intake  and nausea. She is not having pain currently but remains tender  on exam.   Past Medical History: None  Past Surgical History: Uterine polypectomy (vaginally), C-sections   Social History: ___ Family History: No pertinent family history


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with right lower quadrant pain, initially treated for GERD, with recent worsening including decreased oral intake and nausea.  Given the location and worsening nature of the pain, along with the new gastrointestinal symptoms, appendicitis is a primary differential diagnosis. Other possibilities include ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, or other gynecological issues given her surgical history.  A physical exam is needed to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness to better characterize the pain.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on RLQ tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, McBurney's point tenderness, Obturator sign, Psoas sign;  Pelvic exam

ToolMessage:
"On admission, VS: 98.1 93 147/88 18 100% RA GEN: NAD, AAOx3 CV: RRR RESP: CTA b/l ABD: soft, nondistended, focally tender to RLQ without rebound,  positive for voluntary guarding EXT: no peripheral edema or cyanosis"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, decreased oral intake, and nausea. While the initial treatment was for GERD, the worsening symptoms and physical exam findings of focal RLQ tenderness and voluntary guarding raise suspicion for appendicitis.  The lack of rebound tenderness lowers the likelihood, but does not rule it out.  Ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, and other gynecological issues are also considerations given her history of uterine polypectomy and C-sections. Imaging is necessary to differentiate between these diagnoses and confirm or rule out appendicitis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT)  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous administration of 130cc of Omnipaque. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed.  DOSE: DLP: ___ MGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  CHEST: The lung bases are clear with no pleural effusions, nodules, or masses. The visualized portion of the heart and pericardium are normal. There is no pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: The liver is normal in size and homogeneous in enhancement. There is a tiny hypodensity in the right lobe of the liver, in segment 7, which is too small to characterize (2:12). The portal and hepatic veins are patent and there is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is decompressed, and does not contain radiopaque gallstones. The common bile duct is not dilated.  The spleen is normal in size and homogeneous in enhancement. The adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. The pancreas enhances homogeneously without focal lesions. There is no pancreatic ductal dilatation or peripancreatic fat stranding.  The kidneys are normal in size and demonstrate symmetric nephrograms and contrast excretion. The ureters are normal in caliber along their visualized course to the bladder. There are no concerning mass lesions or stones seen within the kidneys. There are no perinephric abnormalities present.  The distal esophagus is normal appearing with no hiatal hernia. The stomach is grossly normal. The small bowel is partially opacified with contrast, and does not show obstructive mass lesions or wall thickening. The large bowel contains feces, without evidence of obstructive mass lesions or wall thickening. There is diverticulosis without diverticulitis.  The appendix is mildly thickened measuring 9 mm in diameter. No gas is demonstrated within the appendix. There is however no surrounding fat stranding.  There is no aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta. The aorta and its major branches are patent. There is mild atherosclerotic calcifications seen in these vessels.  There are no pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes by CT size criteria.  PELVIS: The bladder is under distended, but grossly normal. The uterus is unremarkable. Within the left ovary there is a 2.5 x 2.3 cm cyst with a thick common slightly irregular, hyperdense wall, which likely represents a corpus luteal cyst. The rectum and sigmoid are unremarkable. There is small volume pelvic free fluid. There are no pathologically enlarged pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymph nodes by CT size criteria.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES AND SOFT TISSUES: There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions seen. No hernias are identified. Sclerosis at the iliac side of the SI joint on the left is likely osteitis condensans ilii."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, and decreased oral intake, along with focal RLQ tenderness on exam, initially raised suspicion for appendicitis. The CT scan reveals a mildly thickened appendix (9mm) without surrounding fat stranding or free air, suggesting a low probability of acute appendicitis. The presence of a corpus luteal cyst in the left ovary and small volume pelvic free fluid, combined with her history of gynecological procedures, points towards a gynecological cause for her symptoms, most likely related to the ovarian cyst.  While appendicitis cannot be definitively ruled out, the gynecological findings are the more likely cause of her symptoms.
