Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old female transferred from OSH after  presenting ___ w weakness and diarrhea.  She reports being too  weak to climb out of the tub for approximately 4h until she was found by her son last night.  She  complains of roughly 2 months of diarrhea associated with fecal  incontinence alternating with constipation; she also noticed  occasional bright red blood on the toilet paper.  She was seen  by a gastroenterologist, who felt she had hemorrhoids, and recommended a colonoscopy.  Ms. ___ was taken by her son to ___ where her WBC was 17, and  troponin 0.975 / MB 9.5.  She had a new LBBB on EKG there, which  was new from prior exams at ___.  Shortly after admission, she  complained of new abdominal pain, and a subsequent abdominal CT  revealed "sigmoid perforation with diffuse peritonitis."   When  a surgical consultant recommended colectomy, the patient was  transferred to ___ at the request of her family.  Per OSH  records, she was receiving vancomycin, zosyn, and flagyl.   Tm102.   NPO.  She has never had a colonoscopy.   Past Medical History: Past Medical History:  CAD s/p MI, DES 04, HTN, DM2, neuropathy, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, GERD, HLD  Past Surgical History:  back surgery ___    Social History: ___ Family History: Denies.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a complex medical picture involving a sigmoid perforation leading to peritonitis, likely secondary to a yet-undiagnosed underlying colonic pathology.  Given her history of weight loss, chronic diarrhea alternating with constipation, and rectal bleeding, malignancy is a strong concern.  Her elevated troponin and new LBBB suggest a possible NSTEMI, likely demand ischemia secondary to sepsis.  Before formulating a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan, I need to assess her current hemodynamic stability and the extent of her systemic infection.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show improvement in troponin and CK-MB, suggesting her cardiac demand ischemia has resolved.  Her WBC count has also decreased, indicating a response to the antibiotics.  However, she is anemic, likely due to her ongoing GI bleeding.  I also note her low potassium, which needs to be corrected.  Given her history and current presentation, I believe she requires emergent surgical intervention for her perforated sigmoid colon.  While malignancy is a concern, it needs to be addressed after her acute condition is stabilized.
