HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ yo F with one day of epigastric abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Non-bloody, non-bilious vomitus. Non-bloody, brown, watery diarrhea. A CT scan of the abd/pelvis shows a large, distended gallbladder with a small amount of pericholecystic fluid. US notes the presence of sludge within  the gallbladder, however the patient's pain is clearly centered over the epigastrium and not in the RUQ.   Her LFTs were elevated as listed below, raising concern for a common duct stone (Tbili 1.6, baseline 0.3-0.5), and transaminitis concerning for perhaps some other primary liver disease. Her lipase is elevated, though, which could account for the n/v/d and abdominal pain.     Past Medical History: Type ___ DM--diagnosed in ___, diet controlled   HTN   Left breast CA s/p lumpectomy and ___   Gastric cancer--Stage III, s/p gastrectomy ___   GERD   osteoporosis   arthritis   tinnitus   Fe deficient anemia   cataract      Social History: ___ Family History: Her mother died at age ___ from an unspecified cancer. Her father  died at ___ of "natural causes". No family history of CAD, but  sister has Type ___ DM.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. While the CT scan shows gallbladder abnormalities and elevated LFTs raise concern for a common duct stone, the epigastric pain and elevated lipase suggest possible pancreatitis.  To differentiate between these and other possible diagnoses, further investigation is needed.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's amylase is significantly elevated, confirming pancreatitis.  The markedly elevated AST and ALT, along with elevated total bilirubin, suggest a possible hepatic component or biliary obstruction, despite the epigastric pain location. Given her history of gastric cancer, it's crucial to rule out metastases or other related complications. The patient's glucose is also mildly elevated, consistent with her history of diet-controlled diabetes. Her albumin is low, which could indicate malnutrition or liver dysfunction.  I have enough information to make a differential diagnosis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Gallstone pancreatitis
2. Pancreatitis due to other causes (e.g., medication, hypertriglyceridemia, alcohol - though history doesn't suggest this)
3. Acute cholecystitis
4. Biliary obstruction secondary to malignancy (gastric cancer recurrence/metastasis)

Treatment:
1. **Fluid resuscitation:** Aggressive IV fluids are crucial to maintain hemodynamic stability in acute pancreatitis.
2. **Pain management:** IV opioids (e.g., hydromorphone, fentanyl) are typically required for pain control.
3. **Nausea and vomiting management:**  Antiemetics such as ondansetron or promethazine can be administered.
4. **Nutritional support:** Initially, the patient should be NPO.  If the pancreatitis is mild and resolves quickly, oral feeding can be resumed.
