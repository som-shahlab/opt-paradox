HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ F w/ RLQ pain that woke her from sleep last night. Associated w/ fevers at home to 101. Pain persisted throughout day. Pain sharp, crampy. No nausea, vomiting, diarrhea. No anorexia; ate this morning and states she's hungry. No change in urinary habits.     Past Medical History: asthma hypertension   Social History: ___ ___ History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with right lower quadrant pain, fever, and no gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms. This presentation is concerning for appendicitis.  I need to gather more information through physical exam to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness in the right lower quadrant.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Assess for guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, McBurney's point tenderness, Obturator sign, Psoas sign,  vital signs including temperature

ToolMessage:
"Vitals: 99.5   ___   16   100%RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR  PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended. Tender RLQ. + Rovsing's sign. + Psoas sign."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, fever, and positive Rovsing's and Psoas signs on physical exam. These findings strongly suggest appendicitis. While her fever has decreased, the localized tenderness and peritoneal signs are highly concerning.  I will order a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications like perforation or abscess.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  STUDY: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast; oral contrast was also administered. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also generated.  FINDINGS:  ABDOMEN: The lung bases are clear. The liver shows no focal lesion or intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Gallbladder shows no stones or wall edema. The spleen is normal in size and appearance. The adrenal glands and pancreas show no masses. The kidneys enhance with and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis. The small and large bowel shows no evidence of obstruction or wall edema. The appendix is visualized and its proximal lumen fills with oral contrast and appears normal. However, along the mid-distal appendix which follows a retrocecal course, the wall appear hyperemic and thick with mild infiltration of the surrounding fat. Appendix diamenter measures up to 9 mm. There are no adjacent fluid collections and there is no free air.  PELVIS: The bladder, uterus and rectum appear unremarkable. There is no free fluid or lymphadenopathy.  BONES: There are no aggressive-appearing lytic or sclerotic lesions."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with RLQ pain, fever, and positive Rovsing's and Psoas signs, raising strong suspicion for appendicitis.  The CT scan showed a retrocecal appendix with hyperemic and thickened walls, measuring 9mm in diameter, and mild periappendiceal fat stranding. These findings confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  No abscess or perforation is noted.
Action: done
Action Input: ""
