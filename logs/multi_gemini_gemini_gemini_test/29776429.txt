HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year-old female with hx of PCOS and asthma who presents with about 12 hours of acute, worsening mid-abdominal pain which is now mostly right lower quadrant  pain, also radiating to her back. She also endorses that with the worsening pain she developed nausea and vomited yellow material at about 11 pm last night. Due to the worsening pain she elected to present to the emergency room for evaluation. She notes that for the past few days she has been having some increasing constipation as well. She endorses some increased bloating over the past day. She denies recent travel, unusual foods, or sick contacts. She denies fevers, endorses chills. Denies changes in urinary habits. She denies shortness of breath of chest pain.   ROS: (+) per HPI (-) Denies night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue/malaise/lethargy, changes in appetite, trouble  with sleep, pruritis, jaundice, rashes, bleeding, easy bruising, headache, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, weakness, paresthesias, hematemesis, cramping, melena, BRBPR, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, edema, urinary frequency, urgency   Past Medical History: Past Medical History: PCOS, endometriosis, asthma, migraine headaches   PSH: R hip ___ ___ years ago, multiple laparoscopies for endometriosis (last at ___ ___ years ago)   Social History: ___ Family History: Mother died at age ___ of colon and pancreas cancer


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of PCOS, endometriosis, and right lower quadrant pain radiating to the back, along with nausea, vomiting, and constipation, several differential diagnoses need to be considered, including appendicitis, ovarian cyst rupture or torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease, and bowel obstruction.  A physical exam, laboratory tests, and imaging are needed to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, and rigidity), pelvic exam

ToolMessage:
"Admission  =================== Vitals: T98 HR 104 BP 142/80 RR 16 09% RA  GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Obese, Soft, mildly distended, very tender in the RLQ with rebound, no guarding. normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses DRE: Deferred Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's tenderness in the RLQ with rebound tenderness raises concern for appendicitis.  The lack of guarding is not reassuring, however, given the patient's obesity, guarding may be difficult to appreciate.  The elevated heart rate could be due to pain.  Lab tests are needed to assess for signs of infection and other abnormalities.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, urinalysis, pregnancy test, CRP, ESR

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia is concerning for an infectious or inflammatory process, such as appendicitis.  The urinalysis is essentially normal, making a urinary tract infection less likely.  Although CRP and ESR would be helpful, they are not available.  Imaging is needed to visualize the appendix and surrounding structures.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 6.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 28.9 mGy (Body) DLP = 14.4 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 7.3 s, 57.6 cm; CTDIvol = 27.5 mGy (Body) DLP = 1,585.1 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 1,600 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: There is bibasilar atelectasis without focal consolidation. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder shows layering increased density within the lumen, which may suggest an element of sludge. There is no suggestion of gallbladder distention or wall thickening.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix measures 1.3 cm, is fluid filled, and shows significant surrounding fat stranding and fascial thickening. There is hyperemia and thickening of the cecum. Multiple reactive lymph nodes are seen in the right lower quadrant. No drainable collection is seen surrounding this inflammation. These findings are concerning for uncomplicated ____. There is density at the base of the appendix, likely appendicolith.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. Trace free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Uterus is normal with IUD in situ. Adjacent to the area of inflammation, there is a 3.5 x 2.9 cm lobulated adnexal structure, likely resolving corpus luteum. Left adnexal and appears within normal limits.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with surrounding fat stranding and fascial thickening.  The presence of an appendicolith further supports this diagnosis.  The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, lab results, and imaging are all consistent with appendicitis.  No further information is needed.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with surrounding fat stranding and fascial thickening. The presence of an appendicolith further supports this diagnosis.  The enlarged adnexal structure is likely a resolving corpus luteum and less likely related to the current symptoms, although ovarian pathology cannot be entirely ruled out. The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, laboratory results, and imaging are all consistent with appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian cyst
3. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
4. Endometriosis
5. Bowel obstruction

Treatment:  The patient should be started on IV fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem, or a combination of piperacillin/tazobactam).  A surgical consultation should be obtained for an appendectomy.  Laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred approach, but open appendectomy may be necessary depending on the patient's anatomy and the surgeon's preference.  The patient should be monitored for complications such as perforation, abscess formation, and sepsis.
