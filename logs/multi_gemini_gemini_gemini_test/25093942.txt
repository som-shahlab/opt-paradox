Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/nephrolithiaisis presents with epigastric pain. Pt  initially presented to ___ where he was found to have  gallstones on ultrasound and lipase ___. He was given 1Lns,  levaquin, toradol, dilaudid and transferred to BID ED.   Pt reports feeling pain in the right flank/and abdomen  consistent w/prior kidney stones 2 days PTA. Pain then became  epigastric, associated with emesis x1 and poor PO intake. Unable  to determine if pain related to food. Last BM 4 days ago. No  fevers.  In ED pt given dilaudid and 2L IVF. ERCP and surgery consulted.  On arrival to the floor pt denies nausea. Reports pain well  controlled with dilaudid given in ED.  ROS: +as above, otherwise reviewed and negative   Past Medical History: calcium oxalate kidney stones  - s/p lithotripsy x2 Depression GERD   Social History: ___ Family History: no GI disease


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with epigastric pain, a history of kidney stones, and gallstones found on a recent ultrasound.  Given the history of kidney stones and flank pain, it's crucial to differentiate between a potential kidney stone recurrence, a biliary issue (given the gallstones and elevated lipase), or another gastrointestinal cause. The patient's report of prior kidney stone pain being similar to the initial flank pain in this episode suggests a possible recurrence. The subsequent shift of pain to the epigastric region, accompanied by emesis and poor oral intake, raises concerns about a biliary or gastrointestinal etiology. To differentiate between these possibilities, I need more information about the patient's current pain, a complete blood count to assess for infection or inflammation, and a comprehensive metabolic panel to evaluate kidney function and electrolyte balance. Additionally, imaging of the kidneys and urinary tract is necessary to assess for kidney stones.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count with a high neutrophil percentage, suggesting an inflammatory process.  The significantly elevated lipase (1800 IU/L) along with elevated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and ALT points towards a biliary etiology, most likely gallstone pancreatitis. The normal creatinine and urinalysis make a kidney stone less likely.  While the patient reports pain control, the lab results indicate a serious condition requiring further evaluation and management.  An abdominal CT scan is necessary to visualize the pancreas and surrounding structures to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast is not available among the provided imaging studies. The only available study is an MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC)."

Since a CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast is not available, an MRCP can provide valuable information about the biliary tree and pancreas.
Action: imaging
Action Input: MRCP

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the MRCP report from the available imaging studies.  MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC):  EXAMINATION: MRCP  TECHNIQUE: T1 and T2 weighted multiplanar images of the abdomen were acquired within a 1.5 T magnet, including 3D dynamic sequences obtained prior to, during, and following the administration of 10 cc of Gadavist intravenous contrast. The patient also received oral contrast of 1 cc of Gadavist diluted in 50 cc of water.  FINDINGS: There are mild atelectatic changes at the lung bases without pleural effusion. Gallbladder wall is thickened, irregular, edematous and progressively hyperenhancing, compatible with known history of ____ (4:30). There is no gallbladder wall disruption or pericholecystic fluid. Extensive surrounding parenchymal hepatic arterial hyperenhancement is noted (1301:74) as well as the stranding within the pericholecystic fat. There is cholelithiasis, and a suspected 3 mm stone within the proximal cystic duct (4:32). There is no choledocholithiasis. There is no concerning hepatic mass. There is no intra or extrahepatic bile duct dilation.  The pancreas demonstrates normal parenchymal bulk, normal intrinsic T1 hyperintense signal, and normal homogeneous enhancement. There is no peripancreatic inflammatory change, aside from minimal stranding adjacent to the head likely related to nearby inflammation of the gallbladder. The pancreatic duct is normal in caliber.  The spleen and adrenal glands are unremarkable. There are bilateral subcentimeter cortical renal cysts. Enlarged portacaval and porta hepatis lymph nodes are likely reactive. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is no ascites. Osseous structures are unremarkable.  NOTIFICATION: Findings, specifically dominant findings of ____ without definitive choledocholithiasis, were discussed via phone by Dr ___ with Dr ___ at approximately 9:20am on ___."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with epigastric pain and a history of kidney stones and gallstones. Initial labs showed elevated WBCs and a significantly elevated lipase, raising suspicion for gallstone pancreatitis. The MRCP confirms cholelithiasis, gallbladder wall thickening and edema consistent with cholecystitis, and a suspected stone in the cystic duct.  Importantly, there is no choledocholithiasis or peripancreatic inflammatory changes, making gallstone pancreatitis less likely. The MRCP findings, combined with the lab results and lack of peripancreatic inflammation, suggest acute cholecystitis as the primary diagnosis.  The elevated lipase could be explained by the proximity of the gallbladder inflammation to the pancreas.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Gallstone Pancreatitis
2. Acute Cholecystitis
3. Kidney Stone (unlikely given normal creatinine and urinalysis)
4. Gastritis (less likely given the constellation of findings)
5. Peptic Ulcer Disease (less likely given the constellation of findings)

Treatment:
* NPO (nothing by mouth) initially, then advance to clear liquids as tolerated, followed by a low-fat diet.
* IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte management.
* Pain control with IV analgesics (e.g., dilaudid) as needed, transitioning to oral analgesics as pain improves.
* Antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) for nausea and vomiting if present.
* Close monitoring of vital signs, lipase levels, and abdominal pain.
* Surgical consultation for cholecystectomy, which is typically recommended after resolution of the acute pancreatitis episode to prevent recurrence.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the preferred approach.
* Consider an ERCP if there is evidence of choledocholithiasis or biliary obstruction on subsequent imaging or if the patient's condition deteriorates.
