Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with history of obscure GIB  s/p reported deep enteroscopy and cauterization of SB bleed  ___, afib not on AC due to recurrent falls, CAD s/p LAD PCI  ___, CHF unknown EF, PPM placed ___ for unclear reason, severe  COPD on 2L NC who presents with abdominal pain.   He was transferred from ___ ED after presenting there in the  evening of ___ for 1 day of acute epigastric pain. Patient  states it was sharp, stabbing, pinpoint near RUQ, nonradiating.  Not associated with vomiting but he had nausea. No fever, chest  pain, SOB. No diarrhea. He has chronic R shoulder pain. He had  eaten fried ___ prior to the pain. It has never happened  before. It is still persistent today.  6 hours after the pain started, he was evaluated at ___ ED,  where he had a CT A/P showing cholelithiasis, question of small  area of small bowel edema. His lipase was ___ with normal  TBili. He was given IV zosyn and 2L NS, then sent to ___ ED.   He then received 1L LR and morphine IV for pain here. ___ US showed no biliary duct dilation, gallstones with mild  gallbladder wall edema, trace pericholecystic fluid,   nonspecific.  In the ED, he was seen by gen surgery who did not  think cholecystitis was definitive, and recommended ERCP consult  versus HIDA and admission to medicine.  Of note, last week he had a COPD exacerbation requiring  nebulizers and steroids at an OSH.  History obtained from patient and patient's son.   Past Medical History: -obscure GIB with unremarkable ___ by Dr. ___ in ___ followed by SB capsule endoscopy and deep enteroscopy  with reported cauterization of bleeding site in small bowel in  ___.  -Anemia due to GIB requiring transfusions; had BM biopsy at ___ that was reportedly normal. -afib noted on PPM interrogation, anticoagulation stopped ___ due to recurrent falls (hx SAH from a fall in ___ -PPM placed in ___ (unknown reason) at ___, generator change on ___ at ___  -CAD s/p LAD PCI at ___ in ___ followed by ___ Associates in ___ -CHF unknown EF or last TTE. -severe COPD on 2L NC qhs -PMR followed at ___ rheumatology by Dr ___  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: L knee surgery without hardware placed Appendectomy thyroidectomy   Social History: ___ Family History: Mother had leukemia and diabetes


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric/RUQ pain with concerning features including a history of GIB, recent COPD exacerbation, and multiple comorbidities. The current working diagnosis includes cholelithiasis/cholecystitis, small bowel pathology (given history of GIB and SB edema on CT), and other less likely etiologies like pancreatitis or peptic ulcer disease.  Further information is needed to narrow the differential diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs are significant for elevated lipase, concerning for pancreatitis, as well as elevated AST, ALT, and Alk Phos, which could be due to biliary pathology or other liver disease.  The patient also has anemia and thrombocytopenia. Given the patient's complex history, including a recent COPD exacerbation, history of GIB, and current abdominal pain with concerning lab findings, I believe we have enough information to provide a reasonable differential diagnosis and plan.
