Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric pain radiating to the flanks and back, associated with chills, dizziness, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and loose stool.  The differential diagnosis includes acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis, gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, myocardial infarction, and potentially other abdominal emergencies.  Given the elevated lipase, pancreatitis is high on the differential.  To further evaluate the patient and narrow the differential, more information is needed.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation and lab results suggest acute pancreatitis as the most likely diagnosis. The patient has epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and an elevated lipase.  The absence of an amylase result makes it difficult to definitively diagnose pancreatitis, but the other findings are highly suggestive. The mildly elevated AST and ALT may be related to pancreatitis or other causes. The leukocytosis is consistent with an inflammatory process.  I will request an amylase level to confirm the diagnosis of pancreatitis.  If the amylase is elevated, I will consider the diagnosis confirmed and move to treatment.

Thought: The patient's presentation strongly suggests acute pancreatitis.  She has epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and a significantly elevated lipase. While an elevated amylase would further support the diagnosis, its absence does not rule out pancreatitis, especially given the other findings.  The mildly elevated AST and ALT, along with leukocytosis, are consistent with pancreatitis. Given the strong clinical picture, I am confident in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis.
