HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old woman w/ no significant past  medical history who presents with approximately 18 hours of  umbilical --> RLQ pain. Pain was reportedly sudden in onset,  constant, migrated to RLQ, and associated with nausea and  several loose stools. Pt denies fevers, chills, blood per  rectum, melena, hematemesis.     Past Medical History: Past Medical History: hypothyroidism colon polyp s/p polypectomy transaminitis melena in ___ in setting of GI infection s/p trip to ___  Past Surgical History: ___ and ___: breast augmentation ___: left hand surgery    Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of umbilical pain migrating to the RLQ, accompanied by nausea and loose stools, raises suspicion for appendicitis. However, other diagnoses like gastroenteritis, ovarian torsion, or a urinary tract infection are also possible. I need more information to narrow down the diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign, vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure), abdominal examination (inspection, auscultation, palpation, percussion)

ToolMessage:
"On admission:  Vitals: 98.8 74 115/76 18 100% ra  GEN: A&Ox3, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, ttp in RLQ and in suprapubic region, voluntary guarding, no rebound, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses DRE: deferred Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of appendicitis.  The migration of pain from the umbilical region to the RLQ, along with tenderness in the RLQ, nausea, and loose stools, points towards appendicitis. While the absence of fever and rebound tenderness might argue against it, these signs are not always present in early appendicitis.  The tenderness in the suprapubic region could be referred pain or indicate another process.  A CT scan would help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Axial CT images through the abdomen and pelvis were acquired after administration of intravenous and oral contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were reviewed.  FINDINGS:  ABDOMEN: The lung bases demonstrate minimal dependent atelectasis and are otherwise clear. No pleural or pericardial effusion is seen. The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, kidneys, and visualized portions of the ureters are unremarkable. The gallbladder is full, but otherwise unremarkable. The stomach and small bowel are within normal limits. Stool is seen throughout an otherwise unremarkable colon. There is no free intraperitoneal air or ascites. Visualized vasculature is unremarkable noting an accessory right renal artery.  The appendix is dilated up to 12 mm and fluid filled with several appendicoliths including a 6-mm appendicolith at the base, a 4-mm appendicolith in the mid portion and a 6-mm appendicolith near the tip. There is adjacent stranding. No fluid collection nor extraluminal air is seen.  PELVIS: The bladder, uterus, and rectum are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. No concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are detected."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with appendicoliths and surrounding inflammation. The patient's presentation and the CT findings are consistent with acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with appendicoliths and surrounding inflammation. The patient's clinical presentation and the CT findings strongly support this diagnosis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Ovarian torsion (less likely given normal pelvic findings on CT)
4. Urinary tract infection (less likely given lack of urinary symptoms)
5. Pelvic inflammatory disease (less likely given lack of fever and normal pelvic findings on CT)

Treatment:  The patient should undergo an appendectomy. This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the surgeon's preference and the patient's condition.  Preoperatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem, or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole). Postoperatively, the patient should receive pain control, continue antibiotics as needed, and be monitored for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  The patient should be advised to follow up with their surgeon for wound care and to discuss any ongoing symptoms.
