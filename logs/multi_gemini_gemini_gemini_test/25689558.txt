HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male who presents with 8 hours of  acute onset abdominal pain. The pain began at 2:30am the morning  of admission.  It was periumbilical and then located to the RLQ.   He denied fever and chills.  He did have nausea and emesis the  same morning.  His last meal was the evening prior to admission.   He denied diarrhea, dysuria, and hematuria.  He has not had similar episodes of pain before.    Past Medical History: Right spontaneous pneumothorax   Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, nausea, and vomiting, concerning for appendicitis.  I need to gather more information to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other differentials like mesenteric adenitis, ovarian torsion (if female), or kidney stones.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on McBurney's point tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure;  Auscultation of the abdomen for bowel sounds

ToolMessage:
"On admission:   98.7, 70, 117/63, 16, 100% on room air Gen: no distress, alert and oriented x 3 HEENT: PERLA, EOMI, anicteric Chest: RRR, lungs clear bilaterally Abd: soft, nondistended, tender to palpation in RLQ, no rebound or guarding Ext: no edema, palpable pulses"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with RLQ tenderness on physical exam increases the suspicion for appendicitis.  The absence of rebound tenderness and guarding does not rule out appendicitis.  A CT scan would be helpful to visualize the appendix and confirm the diagnosis, as well as to evaluate for other potential causes of abdominal pain.  Vital signs are stable and within normal limits.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast. Multiplanar reformations were obtained and reviewed.  FINDINGS: The partially imaged lungs and heart are unremarkable.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: The liver, spleen, both adrenals, both kidneys, pancreas and gallbladder are unremarkable. The portal vein is patent. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation is present. The small and large bowel loops are unremarkable. No abdominal free fluid or free air is present. No abdominal, retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria is present. The appendix is retrocecal and is fluid-filled at its distal tip with a hyperenhancing wall and adjacent fat stranding consistent with ____. No fluid collections are present.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles are unremarkable. No pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy or pelvic free fluid is present.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The visible osseous structures show no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions or fractures."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, RLQ tenderness, and positive CT findings of a retrocecal appendix with fluid-filled tip, hyperenhancing wall, and adjacent fat stranding confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of migrating RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, RLQ tenderness, and positive CT findings of a fluid-filled appendix with a hyperenhancing wall and periappendiceal fat stranding confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The patient requires an appendectomy.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Right ureteral calculus
4. Ovarian torsion (if female, not applicable here)
5. Epiploic appendagitis

Treatment:  The patient should be NPO and receive IV fluids for hydration.  Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage (e.g., Cefoxitin, or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole).  Consult surgical services for a laparoscopic appendectomy.  Post-operatively, continue antibiotics as indicated based on intraoperative findings and cultures.  Monitor for complications such as wound infection, abscess formation, and bowel obstruction.  Provide pain management and encourage early ambulation.
