HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old female previously healthy with lower dull abdominal  discomfort started this morning. Has had searing pain in both  sides, more right than left. Along with some back pain, feels as  though she's bloated. Denies fever/chills, n/v, CP/SOB no dysuria. has normal BM. Any movement makes the pain worsening. Currently, the pain in the right lower quadrant and is more severe.    Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of sudden-onset lower abdominal pain, initially bilateral but now localized to the right lower quadrant, worsened by movement, raises suspicion for several conditions, including appendicitis, ovarian torsion, kidney stones, or a gynecological issue.  I need more information about the patient's age, menstrual history, and vital signs to narrow down the possibilities.  A physical exam focusing on the abdomen and pelvic area is crucial at this point.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, palpation, percussion), pelvic exam (if female),  assessing for tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign

ToolMessage:
"upon admission:  ___ Vitals:  99.7  97  125/81  18  100% RA GEN: A&O, NAD   HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist   CV: RRR, No M/G/R   PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R   ABD: Soft, mild distended, severe tenderness at RLQ, Mcburney's positive. Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused   Physical examination"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute lower abdominal pain, initially bilateral and now localized to the right lower quadrant, worsened by movement, with McBurney's point tenderness.  The absence of fever, nausea, and vomiting doesn't rule out appendicitis, which remains high on the differential.  Given the patient's sex, gynecological causes like ovarian torsion or a ruptured ovarian cyst are also possible.  The reported back pain could suggest kidney stones.  A urinalysis can help rule out a urinary tract infection or kidney stones.  A complete blood count (CBC) would help assess for infection or other abnormalities.  Imaging is necessary to visualize the appendix and other pelvic organs.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: Urinalysis, Complete Blood Count (CBC)

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings (McBurney's point tenderness), and elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia strongly suggest appendicitis.  While the urinalysis is normal, making a urinary tract infection or kidney stones less likely, imaging is crucial to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities like ovarian torsion or a ruptured ovarian cyst.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast report. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 743 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: The visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. The hepatic and portal veins are patent.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. The appendix is dilated measuring 12 mm in diameter. There is associated mucosal hyperenhancement, adjacent fat stranding and mesenteric free fluid. There is also a hyperdense ___ clip noted (series 2:image 62). Associated inflammatory changes of the terminal ileum and cecum are noted. The remaining colon is unremarkable.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is a trace amount of free fluid.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus and bilateral adnexae are within normal limits.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No significant atherosclerotic disease is noted. The abdominal aorta and its major branches are patent.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, elevated white blood cell count, and the CT scan findings of a dilated appendix with mucosal hyperenhancement, adjacent fat stranding, and mesenteric free fluid confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam, elevated WBC count, and the CT findings of a dilated appendix with mucosal hyperenhancement, adjacent fat stranding, and mesenteric free fluid confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Torsion
3. Ruptured Ovarian Cyst
4. Kidney Stones
5. Urinary Tract Infection

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment for acute appendicitis. This can be performed laparoscopically or via an open incision.  The patient should be given intravenous fluids and antibiotics preoperatively.  Pain management should be addressed with appropriate analgesics. Post-operative care includes monitoring for complications such as infection, bleeding, or abscess formation.
