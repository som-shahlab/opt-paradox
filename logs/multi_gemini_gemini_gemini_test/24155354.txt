HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year old female who presents with RUQ abd  pain x 8 hours. Patient was eating a fatty meal last night when  she had sharp ___ pain in her R flank that radiated to her RUQ  and R back. She had 3 episodes of NBNB emesis and felt clammy at  times. She denies fevers and chills. She reports having a similar but milder episode 6 weeks ago.     Past Medical History: PMH: Hypertension, Obesity, Diverticula on colonoscopy, hyperlipidemia, treated with lifestyle management, Basal cell skin cancer, Rotator cuff treated with ___  PSH: hammertoe surgery, basal cell carcinoma excision    Social History: ___ Family History: Father - CAD, HTN, prostate cancer; Aunt - breast cancer


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms of RUQ abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and previous similar episode suggest a potential biliary etiology, such as cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis.  However, other diagnoses like pancreatitis, hepatitis, or even renal colic need to be considered. I need to gather more information through laboratory tests and imaging to narrow down the possibilities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show a slightly elevated WBC, which could indicate inflammation or infection. The elevated BUN may indicate dehydration or other renal issues, but creatinine is normal.  LFTs, lipase, and amylase (though not available) are within normal limits, making pancreatitis and hepatitis less likely.  Given the patient's symptoms and the lab results, I still suspect a biliary issue. An ultrasound would help visualize the gallbladder and surrounding structures.
Action: imaging
Action Input: RUQ ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"ABDOMEN US (COMPLETE STUDY) is the closest match to the requested RUQ ultrasound, as it includes comprehensive evaluation of the right upper quadrant structures. Here is the complete report:  ABDOMEN US (COMPLETE STUDY) (Ultrasound): FINDINGS: The liver is of normal echogenicity and architecture without any focal lesions or intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The common bile duct measures 3 mm. The main portal vein is patent with normal hepatopetal flow. There is a single 1.5 cm gallstone lodged within the neck of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is distended but there is no pericholecystic fluid or gallbladder wall thickening. The head and body of the pancreas are unremarkable. The tail is obscured by bowel gas. The right kidney measures 10.6 cm on the left kidney 10.2 cm. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis, stones or concerning lesions. The spleen is normal in size measuring 11.7 cm. The visualized aorta and IVC are unremarkable."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting.  Her labs showed a slightly elevated WBC and BUN. The ultrasound confirms the presence of a gallstone lodged in the gallbladder neck, with gallbladder distension but no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid.  This presentation is highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis. While there is no wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid, the gallstone in the neck causing obstruction is sufficient for the diagnosis, especially given the correlating symptoms.
