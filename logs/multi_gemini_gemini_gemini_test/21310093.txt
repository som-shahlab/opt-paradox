Bedside ultrasound without much ascites. Grossly melanotic stool  on rectal exam. Per patient, she had EGD ___ years ago in which  she was told she had mild gastritis and GERD. A colonoscopy at  ___ ___ months ago was reportedly normal. She received 2U RBC, 1  g ceftriaxone, octreotide (100 mcg IV Q8H), diazepam (10 mg IV,  20 mg PO per CIWA).   On arrival to the MICU, patient was noted to be seeing animals  in the room and confabulating. She did recall possibly being  treated for alcohol withdrawal and seizures at ___ in ___.      Past Medical History: HTN  GERD  Alcohol abuse     Social History: ___ Family History: Noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with jaundice, fatigue, and epigastric cramping, along with a history of chronic alcohol abuse.  Given the elevated liver enzymes (AST/ALT 335/83), hyperbilirubinemia (T. bili 9.4), and coagulopathy (INR 1.8), the primary concern is liver dysfunction, possibly acute alcoholic hepatitis superimposed on chronic liver disease. The patient's history of alcohol abuse, recent possible cessation, and current mental status changes suggest alcohol withdrawal.  However, other causes of liver injury need to be ruled out.  The patient also has anemia and received a blood transfusion, so further investigation into the cause of the anemia is needed.  A physical exam, laboratory tests, and imaging are required to further assess the patient's condition.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show macrocytic anemia, a high AST/ALT ratio, elevated lipase, and acute hepatitis A infection.  The elevated lipase suggests pancreatitis, which could be contributing to the patient's epigastric pain. The macrocytic anemia could be due to chronic alcohol abuse or other causes like B12 or folate deficiency.  The patient also has several electrolyte abnormalities, including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia, hypocalcemia, and low bicarbonate. These could be related to alcohol abuse, malnutrition, or the pancreatitis.  The patient's clinical picture is complex, with evidence of acute alcoholic hepatitis, acute pancreatitis, and acute hepatitis A infection.  While further tests like ammonia, B12, folate, and haptoglobin would be helpful, I have enough information to make a reasonable clinical assessment.
