HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/ T1DM (last a1c ___ in ___, alcohol abuse,  depression who was found obtunded and brought in by EMS to ___  ED. The patient has had prior epsiodes of DKA. She called ___'s  office on ___ for an "infected pimple" on her left ear, but  then did not show up for a ___ urgent care visit, but this  had resolved. She reports having several sick contacts and  complained of some URI symptoms a few days prior to admission,  and had not been taking her medications, including her insulin  (70/30, 26 qam and 24qpm) for at least 2 days. She does have a  history of alcohol abuse and states that she has still been  drinking, last drink was 2 days ago.   In the ED, EKG showed peaked T waves per report but  currently  unable to locate ED EKG to review. Patient got 4amps of bicarb  and 150meq in 1L D5W; ggt 125cc/hr, 4 amps of calcium, insulin  10mg bolus X 2, 5 literes of NS. Labs were notable for negative  etoh and tox screen, lactate of 1.7, lipase of 463, wbc of 23.2,  AP 123, Cr 1.6. Initial ABG was 6.77/___/121/2. Rest of labs  inclduing UA, LFTs, coags were wnl. Blood cx were drawn and  sent. Fem line was placed. CXR was negative. Pt was guiaic  negative; hct 39. While initially patient was only responding to  painful stimuli, she ended up following comands prior to  transfer.   On arrival to the floor vitals are  97.3, HR 117, BP 119/88, RR  20, 100% on 4L NC. The last thing she remembers was being home,  coughing, and then vomiting.     Past Medical History: DM2 w/moderately severe B nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy HTN Depression- one psych hospitalization in ___ for SI h/o EtOH abuse- never experienced withdrawal sx, in early  remission   Social History: ___ Family History: Mother with DM2, HTN. No known family history of cancer.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with altered mental status, history of T1DM, and possible infection. The elevated lipase raises concern for pancreatitis.  Given the history of alcohol abuse, it's crucial to differentiate between alcoholic and other causes of pancreatitis. Additionally, her history of DKA and missed insulin doses warrants further investigation into her current metabolic state.  The elevated WBCs suggest an infectious process, while the patient's report of URI symptoms and possible ear infection needs to be explored. Finally, her history of depression and prior psych hospitalization should be considered in the context of her current presentation.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) with a severely elevated glucose, low bicarbonate, high anion gap, high serum and urine ketones, and high potassium.  The patient also has an elevated lipase suggestive of pancreatitis, which could be secondary to DKA or alcohol use.  The patient also has leukocytosis, likely secondary to DKA and/or possible infection.  The patient is also anemic with macrocytosis, which could be due to alcohol abuse or other causes.  The patient's creatinine is elevated, likely due to dehydration from DKA.  I have enough information to make a plan.
