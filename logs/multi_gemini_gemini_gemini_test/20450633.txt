HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with atrial fibrillation on Xarelto with choledocholithiasis in ___ with ERCP, sphincterotomy, and plastic stent since removed on ___ with repeat ERCP, sphincterotomy, sludge/stone extraction. He was seen at that time by ___ and an extensive discussion regarding laparoscopic cholecystectomy occurred, with patient electing to forgo surgery at that time.  He represents to the emergency department today. He reports sudden onset after dinner (meatloaf + sweet potatoes) over severe lower abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. He reports these are the same symptoms that he had when he initially presented with cholecochlolithiasis in ___. He denies fevers/chills, dyspnea, chest pain.    Past Medical History: - Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation on rivaroxaban  - chronic diastolic heart failure - diabetes type II - asbestosis  - essential tremor - knee osteoarthrosis s/p R knee replacement ___ - ___ esophagus  - colonic adenoma  - obesity  - vit B12 deficiency - BPH with nocturia    Social History: ___ Family History: Reviewed and found to be not relevant to this illness/reason for hospitalization.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's history of choledocholithiasis, prior ERCPs, and current symptoms suggest a possible recurrence of biliary obstruction.  Given the sudden onset of severe lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting after a meal, I need to rule out other potential causes such as pancreatitis, bowel obstruction, or other gastrointestinal issues.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show a normal CBC, CMP (except for elevated glucose), and LFTs.  The elevated INR is concerning given his history of atrial fibrillation and Xarelto use.  The lack of lipase and amylase results hinders my ability to assess for pancreatitis.  An abdominal ultrasound would be helpful to evaluate for choledocholithiasis, and I still need the lipase and amylase to complete my assessment.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of a biliary obstruction, likely due to recurrent choledocholithiasis.  His history, the sudden onset of pain after a meal, and the prior ERCPs point towards this diagnosis. While lipase and amylase were not available, the relatively normal LFTs and the absence of other concerning lab findings make pancreatitis less likely.  The elevated INR is noted and should be addressed, but it doesn't change the likely diagnosis of biliary obstruction.  I will proceed with the assumption that lipase and amylase are normal, as further testing is not available. An abdominal ultrasound would be helpful to confirm the presence of gallstones, but given the strong clinical picture, I'm ready to provide a diagnostic impression.
