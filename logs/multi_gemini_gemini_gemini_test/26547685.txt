HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
The patient is a ___ with PMH depression presents with 1d  abdominal pain and nausea.  Pt reports he was in usual state of health and began  feeling abdominal discomfort yesterday afternoon around 3pm in  the periumbilical region.  Later on in evening, pain became more  severe and moved to his RLQ.  Pain is now severe and is  associated with severe nausea.  Denies vomiting.  Denies  diarrhea.  No anorexia.  Has fevers and chills.     Past Medical History: PSYCHIATRIC HISTORY (INCLUDE PRIOR HOSPITALIZATIONS, OUTPATIENT TREATMENTS, MEDICATION/ECT HISTORY, RESPONSE TO TREATMENT, HISTORY OF HOMICIDAL/SUICIDAL/ASSAULTIVE BEHAVIOR): Pt reports dx of "psychotic disorder" Per OMR, past treatment with ___, MD at ___ On ___ ___ until ___ Patient would not reveal any other information. . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY (INCLUDE HISTORY OF HEAD TRAUMA, SEIZURES, OR OTHER NEUROLOGIC ILLNESS): Pt reports "tooth problems" PCP:  Dr. ___, ___    Social History: ___ Family History: Unknown


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's presentation with abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, accompanied by nausea, fever, and chills, appendicitis is high on the differential. Other possibilities include mesenteric adenitis, gastroenteritis, or a urologic issue. A physical exam is needed to assess for peritoneal signs and localize the pain.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on palpation for tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, McBurney's point tenderness, Psoas sign, Obturator sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate

ToolMessage:
"On Admission: Tm 101.3, Tc 100.2, HR ___, BP 140-150s/90s, SpO2 100% on RA Gen: Appears uncomfortable, AAOx3 HEENT: neck supple, tracahea midline CV: RRR Pulm: CTAB Abd soft, non-distended, exquisite tenderness in RLQ, negative psoas/obturator sign, + Rovsing's, no guarding Rectal: No perirectal tenderness appreciated, no blood, + stool, normal tone Extr: Non-edematous, warm, well-perfused  Prior to"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, fever, and positive Rovsing's sign strongly suggests appendicitis.  The elevated temperature and tenderness further support this. While the negative psoas and obturator signs could argue against it, they aren't always present in appendicitis.  Given the high suspicion for appendicitis, imaging is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. IV Contrast: 130 mL Omnipaque. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. Oral contrast was not administered.  DOSE: This study involved 4 CT acquisition phases with dose indices as follows: 1) CT Localizer Radiograph 2) CT Localizer Radiograph   3) Stationary Acquisition 7.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 33.7 mGy (Body) DLP = 16.9 mGy-cm. 4) Spiral Acquisition 5.0 s, 54.0 cm; CTDIvol = 10.5 mGy (Body) DLP = 568.7 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 586 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. Multiple small accessory spleens are noted in the left upper quadrant.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. Multiple subcentimeter hypodensities in the right kidney are too small to characterize by CT but statistically likely represent cysts. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is dilated and fluid filled measuring up to 16 mm with wall thickening, hyperemia and surrounding inflammation compatible with ____. There is no evidence of perforation.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The reproductive organs are unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with wall thickening, hyperemia, and surrounding inflammation.  There is no evidence of perforation. This information, combined with the patient's history and physical exam findings, is sufficient to make a diagnosis and proceed with treatment.
Action: done

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with wall thickening, hyperemia, and surrounding inflammation.  There is no evidence of perforation, which is good.  The patient requires an appendectomy.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Gastroenteritis
4. Ovarian Cyst/Torsion (if female)
5. Urinary Tract Infection

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for laparoscopic appendectomy.  Administer IV fluids for hydration.  Administer IV antibiotics with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage (e.g., Cefoxitin, or combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole).  Pain management with IV opioids (e.g., Morphine or Hydromorphone).  Post-operative care including wound care, pain management, and monitoring for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  Follow-up with the surgical team.
