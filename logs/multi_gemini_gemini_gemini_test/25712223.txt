InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of abdominal pain, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, anorexia, and vomiting, along with her past medical history of diverticular abscess and pancreatitis, it's crucial to investigate the cause of her current symptoms.  Infectious, inflammatory, and obstructive processes within the abdomen are all possible.  Laboratory tests are needed to assess her current physiological state and provide clues to the underlying etiology.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, anorexia, and vomiting.  Her labs show anemia, hypokalemia, low calcium, and elevated glucose.  While the lipase is normal, her history of pancreatitis warrants further investigation with imaging, especially given the lack of amylase result and urinalysis.  An abdominal CT would be helpful to assess for any acute intra-abdominal pathology.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST is the closest match to the requested imaging. Here is the full report:  TECHNIQUE: Multiple MDCT axial images were obtained from the lung bases through the proximal thighs after uneventful administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenously. Enteric contrast was not administered. Sagittal and coronal reformations were derived.  FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: In the visualized thorax, there is mild bibasilar atelectasis, but no pulmonary effusion or pneumothorax. The heart is enlarged. There is no pericardial effusion. There are vascular calcifications. Mitral annulus is calcified. In the abdomen, the liver, spleen, pancreas, and adrenals appear normal. The gallbladder is surgically absent. There is mild left intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The kidneys symmetrically take up and excrete contrast without obvious hydronephrosis. There are several round hypodensities measuring to 8- mm in the left kidney, too small to characterize. Abdominal loops of bowel appear normal with no abnormality and caliber or pneumatosis. There is suture material in the right bowel. There is no abdominal free fluid or pathologic lymphadenopathy. The abdominal vasculature demonstrates atherosclerotic calcification. Incidental note is made of a retroaortic left renal vein.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Extensive sigmoid diverticulosis is present with evidence of sigmoid ____ (series 2, image 62: series 301B, image 20). No perforation or abscess seen at this site. The bladder and distal ureters, uterus and adnexa appear normal. There is no pelvic free fluid or pathologic lymphadenopathy. A calcific density in the right perirectal space may represent a calcified node.  MUSCULOSKELETAL: There has been a left total hip replacement. No suspicious osteolytic or osteoblastic lesion is seen. Multiple degenerative changes are seen in the spine."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting, and history of diverticular abscess and pancreatitis raised concerns for an intra-abdominal process.  Lab results showed anemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperglycemia.  The CT scan reveals sigmoid diverticulitis with evidence of a contained perforation but no abscess. This finding, combined with the patient's symptoms and history, strongly suggests acute diverticulitis as the cause of her current presentation.
