InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain worsening over three weeks, radiating to the back and scapulae, associated with abdominal distension, nausea, and constipation.  The pain is worse with standing and potentially relieved by eating.  He has a history of obesity, OSA, CAD s/p MI, anxiety/depression, hypercholesterolemia, and his quinapril dose was recently increased.  The initial RUQ ultrasound was unremarkable.  Given the constellation of symptoms and history, several diagnoses are possible, including abdominal aortic aneurysm, mesenteric ischemia, pancreatitis, cholecystitis, peptic ulcer disease, and even atypical presentation of cardiac ischemia.  Further information is needed to narrow the differential.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The significantly elevated lipase points towards acute pancreatitis as the likely diagnosis.  The elevated ALT and BUN may be secondary to pancreatitis.  While amylase is typically also elevated in pancreatitis, the lipase is more specific.  The normal RUQ ultrasound does not rule out pancreatitis, as early imaging can be normal.  I will order an abdominal CT to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen with contrast

ToolMessage:
"While there is a CT Abdomen with and without contrast (CT ABD W&W/O C) available in the list, there isn't a CT Abdomen with contrast only study available. The requested imaging study is not present in the available list of imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The significantly elevated lipase strongly suggests acute pancreatitis.  The elevated ALT and BUN may be secondary to pancreatitis. The normal RUQ ultrasound does not rule out pancreatitis, as early imaging can sometimes be normal. A CT abdomen with contrast is the preferred imaging modality to confirm the diagnosis, assess for complications, and evaluate the extent of pancreatic inflammation. Since a CT with contrast only isn't available, a CT with and without contrast will provide the necessary information.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT ABD W&W/O C

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT ABD W&W/O C report from the available imaging studies:  CT ABD W&W/O C (CT): TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis without and with intravenous contrast and with oral contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were evaluated.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The included portions of the lung bases display no focal concerning lung lesions with some atherosclerotic calcifications noted within the circumflex and PDA coronary arteries. The liver displays severe hepatic steatosis with a vague region of hypoattenuating triangular parenchyma within medial aspect of segment III most suggestive of focal fatty deposition with vessel noted to course through this region on the post-contrast sequences. No parenchymal pancreatic or renal calculi. Post-contrast sequences display normal homogeneous enhancement throughout the majority of the pancreas with very mild edema and peripancreatic stranding about the pancreatic neck, head and uncinate process with no significant pancreatic ductal dilatation or vascular complication seen. No pseudocysts. No significant free fluid is present within the retroperitoneum. Remaining intra-abdominal organs including the gallbladder, liver, spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, bowel, and kidneys appear unremarkable. No free air, free fluid, or pathologically enlarged lymph nodes are noted.  BONE WINDOWS: Degenerative changes are seen in the spine with no aggressive-appearing osseous lesion present."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of abdominal pain radiating to the back, elevated lipase, ALT, and BUN, along with the CT findings of mild edema and peripancreatic stranding around the pancreatic neck, head, and uncinate process, confirms the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The absence of significant pancreatic ductal dilatation, pseudocysts, or free fluid suggests a mild to moderate case.  The patient's history of hypercholesterolemia, recent increase in quinapril dose, and severe hepatic steatosis on CT are potential contributing factors to his pancreatitis.  No other concerning findings were noted on the CT scan.  I have enough information to make a diagnosis.

The patient's history of anxiety/depression and chronic pain should also be considered in his management.
