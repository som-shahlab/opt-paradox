HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Patient is a ___ female with c/o nausea, vomiting, and  epigastric abdominal pain since last night (___).  Pain  midline, radiation bilaterally in band-like fashion.  Unable to  tolerate POs.  Ate chicken and rice for lunch yesterday and then ice cream for dinner.  Pain started after that. Endorses chills overnight but no fevers.  Also with diarrhea overnight.  No dysuria, no headache. Patient was  transferred from OSH for evaluation.   Past Medical History: Rheumatoid Arthritis x ___ Depression   Steroid-induced hypertension   Hyperhydrosis Hyperalgias ___ chronic narcotic use Anxiety Borderline personality disorder   PSH: hemorrhoidectomy (___), triple fusion of the right ankle  in ___, unknown GYN surgery, hemorrhoidectomy ___ (___)    Social History: ___ Family History: No family history of autoimmun disorders


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain radiating bilaterally, and diarrhea after ingesting chicken, rice, and ice cream. This suggests a possible foodborne illness or gastroenteritis.  Given her history of rheumatoid arthritis, steroid-induced hypertension, and chronic narcotic use, it's important to rule out other potential causes of her symptoms, such as peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis, or cholecystitis.  Additionally, her history of depression and anxiety could be exacerbating her symptoms. I need more information to narrow down the diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show significantly elevated lipase and amylase, indicating pancreatitis.  The elevated ALT, AST, and alkaline phosphatase, along with high total bilirubin, suggest possible liver involvement or biliary obstruction.  The high neutrophils and basophils could be a response to the inflammation caused by pancreatitis.  While the initial suspicion of gastroenteritis is not ruled out, the lab results strongly point towards pancreatitis as the primary diagnosis.  I will now conclude the information gathering.
