HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ yo F with 30 hours of RLQ abdominal pain which began  yesterday near her umbilicus. Over the ensuing hours, this has  migrated rightward to her right abdomen. +N/F/C, no vomiting.  Has had a recent GI bug per her report associated with general  malaise, nausea and diarrhea. Denies BRBPR, melena, hematemesis,  CP, SOB.   Past Medical History: PMH: HTN PSH: uterine fibroid removal through ___ incision   Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a ___-year-old female presenting with a 30-hour history of right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain, initially periumbilical then migrating to the RLQ. This presentation is concerning for acute appendicitis.  Given her recent history of a GI bug, other differentials include gastroenteritis, mesenteric adenitis, and pelvic inflammatory disease. To narrow down the diagnosis, I need to assess for peritoneal signs, tenderness at McBurney's point, and evaluate for fever.  A CBC will help assess for leukocytosis suggestive of infection/inflammation.  A urinalysis will help rule out a urinary tract infection.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with assessment for guarding, rebound tenderness, rigidity, and tenderness at McBurney's point;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate

ToolMessage:
"upon admission ___    Temp:99.4 HR:99 BP:162/79 Resp:16 O(2)Sat:99 Normal    Constitutional: Comfortable Chest: Clear to auscultation Cardiovascular: Regular Rate and Rhythm Abdominal: tender RLQ w/o rebound or guard.  +rovsings  sign. +obturator sign. Skin: Warm and dry Neuro: Speech fluent Psych: Normal mentation"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain migrating from the periumbilical region, which is highly suspicious for appendicitis.  Her physical exam findings of RLQ tenderness, positive Rovsing's sign, and positive obturator sign further increase the likelihood of appendicitis.  The slight fever also supports an infectious/inflammatory process. While she does not have rebound tenderness or guarding, these signs may not always be present in early appendicitis.  Given the concerning presentation and physical exam findings, I would proceed with imaging to evaluate for appendicitis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast matches the available imaging studies. Here is the complete report:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT helical images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis after administration of 130 cc of Optiray intravenous contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats were generated and reviewed.  FINDINGS: Three pulmonary nodules are seen in the right lung base, with the largest perifissural nodule measuring 6 mm. The imaged lung bases demonstrate mild subsegmental atelectasis without pleural effusions. There is a small hiatal hernia. The liver demonstrates homogeneous enhancement without focal lesions. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is normal. The adrenal glands are normal. The spleen and pancreas are normal. Both kidneys show symmetric opacification and excretion of contrast without evidence of hydroureteronephrosis. No bowel obstruction is seen. The appendix is significantly dilated, measuring up to a maximum of 15 mm and is fluid filled. An 8-mm appendicolith is seen at the base of the appendix. There is extensive fat stranding surrounding the appendix. There is no evidence of drainable fluid or definite free air. Multiple prominent mesenteric lymph nodes are seen in the right lower quadrant. No significant retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is detected. The abdominal aorta is normal in course and caliber.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The urinary bladder and the distal ureters are unremarkable. The uterus and adnexa are normal. The sigmoid colon and rectum are unremarkable. Scattered diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon is present, without evidence of acute diverticulitis. No adenopathy or free fluid is detected.  BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: Fluid-density lesion within the right sacrum (2A:57) may represent a Tarlov's cyst. No other suspicious bone lesions are detected."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT scan confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The CT scan demonstrates a dilated appendix measuring 15mm with an appendicolith and surrounding fat stranding, which are all classic findings of appendicitis.  The patient requires surgical intervention.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT scan confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The CT report clearly shows a dilated appendix measuring 15mm with an appendicolith and surrounding fat stranding, which are all classic findings of appendicitis.  The patient requires an appendectomy.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Gastroenteritis
4. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
5. Ovarian Cyst

Treatment:  Consult surgery for laparoscopic appendectomy.  Administer IV fluids for hydration.  Administer IV antibiotics with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage (e.g., Cefoxitin, or combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole).  Provide pain control with IV analgesics (e.g., Morphine or Hydromorphone).  Post-operatively, continue IV antibiotics until afebrile and tolerating a regular diet.  Monitor for complications such as surgical site infection, abscess formation, and bowel obstruction.  Provide discharge instructions including wound care, pain management, and follow-up.
