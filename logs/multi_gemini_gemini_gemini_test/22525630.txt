HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/ no PMHx presents with 6 days of periumbilical pain which progressively migrated into her RLQ approximately two days ago. Pain was not associated with fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, chills, or anorexia. Given the persistence of her  pain, she presented to ___ for further workup and evaluation.   ROS: as per HPI, otherwise denies weight loss, night sweats, constipation, diarrhea, dysuria, hematuria, prior similar episodes   Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, concerning for appendicitis.  I need to gather more information to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other differentials like ovarian torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease, or gastroenteritis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, concerning for appendicitis. Physical exam findings show tenderness in the RLQ and suprapubic region, positive Rovsing's sign, and negative obturator/psoas signs.  While these findings suggest appendicitis, I need additional information to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of inflammation.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's history and physical exam suggest appendicitis.  Lab results are mostly normal, though some CMP values are missing.  A slightly elevated WBC could suggest inflammation, but it's not definitive. Imaging is necessary to visualize the appendix and confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the full report for \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT)\":  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen pelvis  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 224 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. Appendix is abnormal with mucosal hyperemia, fluid-filled and dilated up to 11 mm with mild periappendiceal fat stranding and fluid. No definite appendicolith. No free air or drainable collection.

NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___ ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 16:55, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT scan demonstrating an abnormal appendix with mucosal hyperemia, fluid-filling, dilatation, and periappendiceal fat stranding are consistent with acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with migrating abdominal pain from periumbilical to RLQ, a classic symptom of appendicitis. Physical exam findings included RLQ tenderness and a positive Rovsing's sign, further supporting the possibility of appendicitis. Laboratory results were largely unremarkable, but the CT scan confirms the diagnosis, revealing an inflamed and dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding and fluid, consistent with acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Cyst (incidental finding)
3. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (ruled out by imaging and lack of fever/vaginal discharge)
4. Gastroenteritis (ruled out by imaging and lack of vomiting/diarrhea)
5. Constipation (ruled out by history and imaging)

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment for acute appendicitis. This can be performed laparoscopically or via an open procedure.  Given the patient's presentation and CT findings, a laparoscopic appendectomy is recommended.  Pre-operatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole) to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.
