HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with PMH diverticulosis presents with acute abdominal pain  starting day prior to admission. Pain onset was shudden and  described as sharp, aching, ___ pain diffusely but most  prominant in periumbilical and left lower quadrant. Pain has  been constant with decrease in appetite, worse with PO intake,  thus she has not had any in the past 2 days. Last BM was this  morning and noted to be hard, non-melenotic, light-colored, with  little blood on stool and in bowl. Reports nausea, denies  vomiting. No fevers but reports chills last night. Currently  passing gas. No history of abdominal surgery. Has never had pain  like this before.   In the ED, initial vital signs were 10 97.0 111 125/87 18.  Patient was started on cipro/flagyl and admitted for IV  hydration given she is unable to take PO. CBC and Chem-7 were  within normal limits.   On the floor, initial vitals were 97.4 107/49 89 18 100% RA.  Patient is complaining of a headache, which she says is likely  because she can't eat anything. Her abdominal pain is returning  and feels like a ___. Otherwise, she is feeling rather hungry.     Past Medical History: hypertension diverticulosis    Social History: ___ Family History: father passed from alcoholic cirrhosis, mother has hypertension  but is alive. has a healthy sister. no history of cancer in the  family.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, concerning for a possible complication of diverticulosis such as diverticulitis. The location, quality, and associated symptoms (change in bowel habits, nausea, chills) are suggestive of this. However, the lack of fever and leukocytosis is atypical. Other diagnoses to consider include irritable bowel syndrome, gastroenteritis, or even ischemic colitis given her age and history of hypertension. I need more information to narrow down the differential diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam (assessing for tenderness, guarding, rebound, distension, bowel sounds), vital signs, Cardiovascular exam,  Lung exam

ToolMessage:
"Admission Exam: Vitals-  T 97.4  BP 107/49  HR 89  RR 18  O2 Sat: 100% RA General: alert and oriented x3, no acute distress HEENT: PERRLA, sclera nonicteric, dry mucous membranes,  oropharynx clear without lesions Neck: supple, no lymphadenopathy appreciated CV: r/r/r, soft systolic murmur heard at left sternal border Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally Abdomen: soft, nondistended, rebound tenderness, pain on  palpation most in umbilical and left lower quadrant, no  hepatosplenomegaly appreciated, normoactive bowel sounds GU: no foley Ext: no clubbing cyanosis or edema, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses  bilaterally Neuro: CN II-XII intact, ___ strength upper and lower  extremities, sensation grossly intact, 2+ brachioradialis and  biceps reflexes"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with acute abdominal pain, most prominent in the periumbilical and left lower quadrant, along with rebound tenderness on exam, points towards an inflammatory process in the abdomen.  Diverticulitis remains high on the differential, even with a normal WBC count. The lack of fever could be due to the antibiotics she received in the ED.  Ischemic colitis is also a possibility given her age and hypertension.  The patient's hypotension is concerning and needs to be addressed. I need further imaging to evaluate the bowel and assess for any complications.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast report. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis after the uneventful administration of 150 mL Omnipaque. Coronal sagittal reformations are provided and reviewed. Oral contrast was not administered. After the administration of intravenous contrast, the patient complained of tachypnea and tachycardia. The tachycardia quickly resolved, however, there was persistence of an \"itchy throat.\" After being evaluated by Dr. ___ in the CT scanner, the patient returned to the emergency department uneventfully. Dr. ___ was notified of this by telephone at 16:04 on ___. DLP: 880.03 mGy/cm.  FINDINGS: Abdomen: The included lung bases show no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The imaged heart is normal in size and there is no pericardial effusion. The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesions. There is cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast without hydronephrosis. The ureters are normal in caliber. The stomach and small bowel are normal. There is a focus of stranding and bowel wall thickening within the sigmoid colon, consistent with ____. There is no extraluminal air or adjacent fluid collection. The appendix is normal. The aorta and major branches are unremarkable. The portal vein, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein are patent. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  Pelvis: The bladder is unremarkable. The rectum is normal. There is a 5.6 cm simple appearing cyst within the right adnexa. An IUD is within the uterus. The left ovary contains a small follicular cyst.  Bones: There are no concerning lytic or blastic osseous lesions."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of diverticulitis with sigmoid diverticulitis with associated inflammation and bowel wall thickening.  The patient's hypotension likely resulted from dehydration due to decreased oral intake and should improve with IV fluids. The allergic reaction to the IV contrast was mild and resolved quickly.  The adnexal cyst is noted but likely incidental and doesn't explain her current symptoms. I have enough information to make a diagnosis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with acute abdominal pain, initially periumbilical then localizing to the left lower quadrant, with rebound tenderness and a change in bowel habits. While her initial labs were unremarkable, the CT scan confirms the diagnosis of diverticulitis with sigmoid bowel wall thickening and stranding, but no abscess or perforation. The patient also experienced an allergic reaction to the IV contrast, presenting as tachypnea, tachycardia, and an itchy throat, which resolved quickly.  Her hypotension also needs to be addressed.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Diverticulitis
2. Irritable Bowel Syndrome
3. Ischemic Colitis
4. Gastroenteritis
5. Ovarian Cyst

Treatment:
1. **Antibiotics:** Continue current regimen of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole for 7-10 days to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria common in diverticulitis.
2. **Bowel Rest:**  Initially NPO, then advance to clear liquids as tolerated.  Progress to a low-residue diet once symptoms improve, and gradually return to a regular diet.
3. **Pain Management:** Administer IV fluids for hydration and manage pain with IV analgesics such as morphine or hydromorphone initially, transitioning to oral analgesics like acetaminophen or ibuprofen as pain improves.
4. **Hypotension Management:** Administer IV fluids (e.g., normal saline) to address hypotension. Monitor vital signs closely. If hypotension persists, consider further workup to determine the cause.
5. **Allergic Reaction Management:** Document the contrast allergy.  Prescribe diphenhydramine as needed for any future allergic reactions.  Consider premedication with steroids and antihistamines if contrast is absolutely necessary in the future.
6. **Follow-up:**  Advise the patient to follow up with their primary care physician or a gastroenterologist within 1-2 weeks after completing antibiotics.  Discuss the importance of a high-fiber diet and adequate hydration to prevent future episodes of diverticulitis.  If symptoms recur or worsen, instruct the patient to return to the ED immediately.  Consider a colonoscopy after the acute episode resolves to rule out other pathology.
