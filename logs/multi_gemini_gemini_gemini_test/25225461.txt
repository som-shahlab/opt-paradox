HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with history of HTN presents from OSH with one day of severe epigastric pain and N/V. Patient reported crampy,  epigastric 10++/10 abdominal pain with 8 episodes of NBNB emesis  consisting of undigested food. On day of admission, he had 5  BMs, consisting of loose,mixed light colored/brown stools,  non-bloody. Pt denied melena, BRBPR, fever, chills, or night sweats. Pt endorsed having  similar episodesof pain and nausea over the last ___ years,  which he attributedto indigestion. He was unable to seek medical  help until ___ due to insurance issues. An US then showed  multiple gallstones, and he was advised to have cholecystectomy,  which he postponed due to insurance situation.     Past Medical History: HTN (dx in ___ Kidney stones (began in ___ and passes ___ per year)    Social History: ___ Family History: Family History:  Mother: D2M, MI.  Father: ___, MI.  Brother: ___.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Severe epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting could indicate a number of gastrointestinal issues, including pancreatitis, cholecystitis, or gastritis. Given the patient's history of gallstones, cholecystitis is a strong possibility.  The loose stools could be related to the pain and nausea, or could indicate another process.  It's important to rule out other serious conditions and gather more information about the current episode.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with severe epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and loose stools.  They have a history of gallstones and previous ultrasound findings confirming this.  Lab results show significantly elevated lipase and amylase, pointing towards acute pancreatitis.  Elevated ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin suggest biliary involvement, likely gallstone pancreatitis.  The patient's history of similar pain episodes further supports this.  While the WBC count is slightly elevated, it is not significantly concerning at this time.  I have enough information to make a recommendation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Biliary Pancreatitis
2. Acute Cholecystitis
3. Gastritis
4. Peptic Ulcer Disease
5. Gastroenteritis

Treatment:
* Admit the patient for supportive care and monitoring.
* NPO (nothing by mouth) initially, then advance to a low-fat diet as tolerated.
* IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte management.
* Pain control with IV opioids (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone).
* Antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) for nausea and vomiting.
* Close monitoring of vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.
* Serial lipase and amylase measurements to track disease progression.
* Abdominal imaging (e.g., CT scan) to assess the severity of pancreatitis and identify any complications.
* Consult with a surgeon for possible cholecystectomy once the acute pancreatitis subsides.  This is important to prevent recurrent episodes of gallstone pancreatitis.
* Consider endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) if there is evidence of biliary obstruction or cholangitis.
