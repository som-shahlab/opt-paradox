HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ old male who presents to his PCP today with symptoms of RLQ pain and melena. Of note, he was recently seen in the ED with hematemesis in the setting of ETOH on ___ and had a negative NGT lavage and was sent home. He was starting to feel better until ___ evening when he developed sudden onset of sharp RLQ pain comming in waves, no radiation as well as 3 episodes of loose black tarry stools and rigors. He does use NSAIDs for pain control occassionally.   Of note his last colonoscopy was in ___ and it showed colonic polyps. He is due for his next colonoscopy ___ years from that colonoscopy. He never had an EGD.     Past Medical History: carcinoma in situ of rectum, high blood sugars, HTN, HA, suicide  attempt, polysubstance abuse   Social History: ___ Family History: father died of MI at ___, brother with CABG at age ___, mother  died of brain aneurysm.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, melena, and rigors, raising concerns for several possible diagnoses including lower gastrointestinal bleeding, appendicitis, or diverticulitis.  The recent history of hematemesis and ETOH use suggests a possible upper GI source of bleeding, but the negative NGT lavage and the new onset of RLQ pain and melena point towards a lower GI source.  His history of colonic polyps increases the risk of colorectal cancer.  Given the concerning symptoms and history, I need to gather more information through laboratory tests and imaging to narrow down the differential diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count with elevated neutrophils, which could indicate an inflammatory process or infection.  However, most other lab values are within normal limits.  The negative blood in the urinalysis argues against a kidney stone.  The lack of available results for PTT, amylase, and stool guaiac hinders a complete assessment.  A positive stool guaiac would confirm the presence of blood in the stool, supporting the melena finding.  Amylase and lipase would help evaluate for pancreatitis, although the patient's lipase is normal.  Imaging is necessary to visualize the abdominal structures and identify the source of the patient's RLQ pain and melena.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is not available in the list. The only available study is a CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's RLQ pain, melena, and history of colonic polyps, a CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast is suboptimal but can still provide some information.  While IV contrast would be ideal for better visualization of vascular structures and inflammation, a non-contrast CT can still help identify masses, bowel wall thickening, or other abnormalities.  I will proceed with the available non-contrast CT and then reassess the need for further imaging or testing based on the results.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast report, which matches the requested imaging exactly:  CT ABD & PELVIS W/O CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness with oral contrast only. Coronal and sagittal reformats were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness.  CT ABDOMEN: A calcified granuloma is seen in the right lower lobe (2:8). The lungs are otherwise clear. There is no pleural effusion. A small pericardial effusion is unchanged from ___. Fat stranding centered around the appendix is noted with mild dilatation of the appendiceal tip to 8 mm. There is slight thickening of the cecal base. No contrast or air are seen within the appendix despite contrast in the cecum. There is no drainable fluid collection and no free air. Tiny lymph nodes in the region are prominent but not pathologically enlarged by CT size criteria. Evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs is limited without intravenous contrast. Within this limitation, the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys appear normal without nephrolithiasis or hydronephrosis. The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber. No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Atherosclerotic calcifications are seen in the aorta without aneurysmal dilatation.  CT PELVIS: The rectum, sigmoid colon, bladder, and prostate are normal. No free fluid and no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  BONE WINDOWS: No lytic or sclerotic lesion suspicious for malignancy is seen. Exostosis is noted at the left lesser trochanter."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast shows fat stranding around the appendix with mild dilatation of the appendiceal tip, suggesting appendicitis.  The slight thickening of the cecal base could be related to the appendicitis or could indicate another process.  While the absence of IV contrast limits the evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs, the findings of appendicitis are concerning.  The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, melena, and rigors, along with the CT findings, strongly suggests appendicitis as the primary diagnosis.  Although the melena is not fully explained, it could be related to a separate issue or potentially a consequence of the inflammatory process affecting the bowel.  Given the strong suspicion for appendicitis, I would recommend surgical consultation for further evaluation and management.

Thought: The CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast reveals fat stranding around the appendix with mild dilatation of the appendiceal tip, suggesting appendicitis.  The slight thickening of the cecal base could be related to the appendicitis or could indicate another process.

Colorectal cancer is a possibility given the patient's history of colonic polyps, but the current presentation is more consistent with appendicitis.  Ischemic colitis is also less likely given the localized findings.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Diverticulitis
3. Colorectal Cancer
4. Ischemic Colitis
5. Upper GI bleed

Treatment:  The patient should be admitted to the hospital for surgical evaluation and likely appendectomy.  IV fluids should be initiated for hydration.  Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered to cover likely enteric organisms.  Pain management should be provided with opioid analgesics.  A surgical consult should be obtained.  Further investigation into the cause of the melena can be pursued after the acute appendicitis is addressed.  This may include a colonoscopy or EGD once the patient is stable.  The patient's history of polysubstance abuse should be considered in pain management and post-operative care.
