HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This patient is a ___ year old male who presents c/o three days of abd pain. The patient states the pain was initially diffuse and has localized to the right lower quadrant. Additionally he notes some subjective fevers and decreased appetite. He denies nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, black or bloody stool.                        Timing: Gradual                       Quality: Dull                      Severity: Moderate                      Duration: 3 Days                      Location: Right lower quadrant      Past Medical History: PMH:PVD, Tobacco abuse, pancreatitis, Remote cervical spine and  lower back injury   PSH: R EIA stent/L CIA stent ___, L hand fx      Social History: ___ Family History: Family History:  There is no family history of premature atherosclerosis or peripheral vascular disease.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain localized to the RLQ, concerning for appendicitis. Given the patient's history of PVD and tobacco abuse, other diagnoses such as mesenteric ischemia or abdominal aortic aneurysm must also be considered.  I need vital signs to assess for systemic illness and further characterize the abdominal pain.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign),  cardiovascular exam (auscultation for bruits), rectal exam (assess for tenderness, masses, or occult blood)

ToolMessage:
"___:    Vitals: 100.9 98.9 93 107/57 18 95% on mRA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR,  PULM: unlabored respirations ABD: Soft, nondistended, RLQ tenderness to palpation, +  guarding, + obturator sign, no palpable masses Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused  Physical examination"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain localized to the RLQ with fever, tachycardia, and guarding, concerning for appendicitis.  The positive obturator sign further supports this diagnosis.  While other diagnoses such as mesenteric ischemia or abdominal aortic aneurysm are less likely given the exam findings, they cannot be definitively ruled out.  I will order a CBC and CMP to assess for leukocytosis and electrolyte abnormalities, as well as a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast to evaluate for appendicitis and alternative diagnoses.
Action: done

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
