HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Per admitting resident: ___. female p/w acute onset  periumbilical and RLQ pain for 1.5 days.  Reports fever and  nausea.  No emesis.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: none  Past Surgical History: none    Family History: N/C


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, fever, and nausea, raising suspicion for appendicitis.  A physical exam is necessary to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on McBurney's point tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure

ToolMessage:
"On admission: General: as noted in HPI HEENT: all normal, denies changes in vision/hearing Respiratory: all normal, denies SOB/DOE/cough/wheeze/hemoptysis/pain Cardiac: all normal, denies angina/palpitations GI: as noted in HPI GU: all normal, denies dysuria Skin: all normal, denies rash/lesions/pruritis Musculoskeletal: all normal, denies joint pain/swelling, denies back pain Neurological: all normal, denies headache, denies numbness/tingling Endocrine: all normal, denies sensitivity to heat/cold Hematologic: all normal, denies easy bruising/bleeding Psychiatric: all normal, denies mood change"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The initial physical exam suggests possible appendicitis, but lacks specific findings.  Lab tests are needed to assess for signs of infection and other potential causes of abdominal pain.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, urinalysis, CRP

ToolMessage:
"I'll help you organize the results for the requested tests:  CBC with differential: - White Blood Cells: 18.6 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 4.65 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 14.0 g/dL - Hematocrit: 43.1% - MCV: 93.0 fL - MCH: 30.1 pg - MCHC: 32.4% - RDW: 13.2% - Platelet Count: 264.0 K/uL - Differential:   - Neutrophils: 92.1%   - Lymphocytes: 5.0%   - Monocytes: 1.8%   - Eosinophils: 0.9%   - Basophils: 0.2%  CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel): - Sodium: 137.0 mEq/L - Potassium: 3.8 mEq/L - Chloride: 102.0 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 25.0 mEq/L - Glucose: Negative - Urea Nitrogen: 13.0 mg/dL - Creatinine: 0.8 mg/dL - Albumin: 4.2 g/dL - Total Bilirubin: 0.6 mg/dL - Alkaline Phosphatase: 60.0 IU/L - ALT: 15.0 IU/L - AST: 19.0 IU/L  Urinalysis: - Appearance: Clear - Color: Yellow - Specific Gravity: 1.024 - pH: 5.5 units - Protein: Trace - Glucose: Negative - Ketones: 40.0 mg/dL - Blood: Negative - Nitrite: Negative - Leukocytes: Negative - WBC: 3.0 #/hpf - RBC: 2.0 #/hpf - Epithelial Cells: 1.0 #/hpf - Bacteria: None - Yeast: None - Mucous: Few - Calcium Oxalate Crystals: Few  CRP (C-Reactive Protein): This test result is not available in the provided data."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute RLQ pain, fever, nausea, and an elevated WBC with neutrophilia, highly suggestive of appendicitis.  While a CRP would be helpful, imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT data were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis after administration of oral and intravenous contrast. Images were displayed in multiple planes.  FINDINGS: Abdomen: The visualized lung bases are clear. The liver enhances homogeneously. A 5 mm hypodensity in the mid right lobe is too small to characterize (2: 10). There are no concerning liver lesions. The portal and hepatic veins are patent. The gallbladder is mildly distended without pericholecystic fluid. The pancreas and spleen are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly. There is a 3.1 cm AP x 1.9 cm TV x 2.1 cm CC soft tissue lesion arising from the left adrenal gland. The right adrenal gland is normal. There is no ascites or abdominal adenopathy. The stomach, small and abdominal large bowel are unremarkable. There is a small amount of contrast refluxing into the distal esophagus. No free air.  Pelvis: The appendix is distended to 8 mm and filled with fluid. The wall is hyperemic and mildly thickened, with mild adjacent stranding. There is a tiny appendicolith at the appendix base (2:52). There is no adjacent fluid collection or extraluminal gas. The remainder of the bowel is unremarkable. There is a small pocket of mildly complex free fluid in the rectouterine pouch (2: 57). There is no inguinal or pelvic adenopathy. There is no concerning lytic or sclerotic bone lesion."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute RLQ pain, fever, nausea, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and the CT findings of a distended appendix with a thickened, hyperemic wall, periappendiceal stranding, and an appendicolith are all highly suggestive of acute appendicitis. The presence of free fluid in the rectouterine pouch further supports this diagnosis.  The incidental finding of a left adrenal lesion requires follow-up but is not relevant to the current acute issue.
Action: done
Action Input: ""
