HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Pt is ___ y/o F who presents with sudden onset epigastric pain  that started last night after eating pizza for dinner.  Pain is  sharp and has moved to right upper quadrant.  Pt has had nausea.   No fevers, chills, or vomiting.    Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset epigastric pain radiating to the right upper quadrant, along with nausea, suggest a possible biliary colic or cholecystitis.  Given the patient's symptoms, it's important to rule out other differential diagnoses such as pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, or gastritis.  I need more information to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: laboratory tests

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show a slightly elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia, which could indicate an inflammatory process.  Lipase, liver function tests, and CMP are all within normal limits, making pancreatitis, hepatitis, and other metabolic derangements less likely.  The patient's presentation is highly suspicious for cholecystitis, and imaging is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: RUQ ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested RUQ ultrasound matches with the available LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) study. Here is the full report:  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) FINDINGS: The gallbladder is mildly distended and contains echogenic material with posterior shadowing and consistent with cholelithiasis. However, there is no evidence of gallbladder wall thickening, gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid. The liver is normal in echotexture with no focal liver lesions identified. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The common bile duct is normal measuring 3 mm. The visualized portions of the pancreas are normal however, portions of the pancreatic body and tail are obscured by bowel gas and not fully seen. The right kidney is normal without hydronephrosis."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with sudden onset epigastric pain radiating to the right upper quadrant, accompanied by nausea.  The initial differential diagnosis included biliary colic, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastritis.  Laboratory tests revealed a slightly elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia, but lipase, liver function tests, and CMP were within normal limits, making pancreatitis, hepatitis, and other metabolic abnormalities less likely.  The RUQ ultrasound confirmed the presence of cholelithiasis without signs of cholecystitis such as gallbladder wall thickening, edema, or pericholecystic fluid.  The patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with biliary colic.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient is a ___ y/o female presenting with sudden onset epigastric pain radiating to the RUQ, nausea, and no fever, chills, or vomiting.  Labs showed a mildly elevated WBC with neutrophilia.  RUQ ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis (no wall thickening, edema, or pericholecystic fluid).  The patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with biliary colic.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Biliary Colic
2. Cholecystitis (subclinical/early)
3. Gastritis
4. Peptic Ulcer Disease
5. Pancreatitis

Treatment:  Conservative management is recommended initially.  This includes pain control with NSAIDs or other analgesics as needed, a low-fat diet, and observation.  If symptoms persist or worsen, surgical consultation for possible cholecystectomy should be considered.  The patient should be educated on the signs and symptoms of cholecystitis and instructed to return to the clinic or emergency department if they experience fever, chills, persistent vomiting, or worsening pain.
