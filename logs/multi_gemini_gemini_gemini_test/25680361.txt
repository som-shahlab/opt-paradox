InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with chest pain radiating to the abdomen and back, associated with nausea and black stools for two days.  Given his history of CAD, CABG, PCI, aortic stenosis, VT/VF arrest, CHF, and afib on coumadin, the differential diagnosis includes acute coronary syndrome, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other abdominal pathologies. To differentiate between these, I need more information.

Thought: The patient's labs show elevated glucose, BUN, and creatinine, possibly indicating acute kidney injury or worsening of his chronic kidney disease.  His PT is also elevated, but the INR is within the therapeutic range for someone on coumadin.  The negative troponin makes ACS less likely.  I still need to assess for GI bleed given the black stools.

His PT is also elevated, but the INR is within the therapeutic range for someone on coumadin.  The negative troponin makes ACS less likely.  I still need to assess for GI bleed given the black stools.  Since the requested tests are not available, I will proceed with my assessment. The patient has a history of diverticulosis, recent abdominal pain, and now presents with black stools and LLQ abdominal pain that improves after eating.  These symptoms, combined with the lack of other alarming findings, suggest a possible GI bleed, likely from a diverticular source.
