HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ p/w RUQ abdominal pain x3 days and emesis today x3.  The  pain began 3 days ago as a dull ___ ache localized to the RUQ  and R epigastrium accompanied by fatigue and 1 episode of  chills. The pain progressed to an ___ sharp pain 1 day ago but  the patient tolerated normal PO intake.  She then had 3 episodes  of non-bloody emesis.  Last BM was 2 days ago and was non-bloody  and well-formed.  Pt. denies fever, diarrhea, jaundice,  pruritus, changes in stool/urine color, and back/shoulder pain.   Pain is now well-controlled on morphine.   Past Medical History: PMH: PUD well-controlled on Prilosec PSH: open L salpingo-oopherectomy - ___ (___)   Social History: ___ Family History: Brother - PUD; otherwise NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, emesis, and chills, which could indicate several conditions, including cholecystitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, or peptic ulcer disease.  Given her history of PUD, it is important to differentiate between a PUD exacerbation and other potential causes. I need more information to narrow down the possibilities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results are all within normal limits, which helps rule out some of the initial differential diagnoses like pancreatitis, hepatitis, and choledocholithiasis.  However, the patient still has significant RUQ pain and emesis.  An ultrasound of the RUQ would be helpful to evaluate for cholecystitis or other biliary pathology.
Action: imaging
Action Input: RUQ ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound):  EXAMINATION: Right upper quadrant ultrasound.  FINDINGS: The liver demonstrates no focal or textural abnormalities. The main portal vein is patent with appropriate hepatopetal flow. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. There is gallbladder wall edema. There is pericholecystic fluid. A positive sonographic ___ sign was elicited. Large shadowing gallstone is seen in the region of the neck, upon maneuvers was unable to be repositioned. The pancreas is not well visualized."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain, emesis, and chills.  Labs were unremarkable except for a normal lipase.  RUQ ultrasound shows gallbladder wall edema, pericholecystic fluid, a positive sonographic Murphy's sign, and a large gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. These findings are highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain, emesis, and chills.  While lab tests were normal, the RUQ ultrasound shows gallbladder wall edema, pericholecystic fluid, a positive sonographic Murphy's sign, and a large gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder. These findings are highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis.  The patient's history of PUD is less likely to be the primary cause of her current symptoms given the ultrasound findings and lack of other concerning labs.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Cholecystitis
2. Peptic Ulcer Disease Exacerbation
3. Biliary Dyskinesia
4. Hepatitis
5. Pancreatitis

Treatment:  The patient should be admitted for IV fluids, pain control, and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., ceftriaxone and metronidazole).  A surgical consultation should be obtained for laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is the definitive treatment for acute cholecystitis.  NPO status should be maintained until nausea and pain subside.  Once the patient tolerates oral intake, a low-fat diet is recommended.  After discharge, the patient should follow up with her surgeon and primary care physician for post-operative care and management of her PUD.
