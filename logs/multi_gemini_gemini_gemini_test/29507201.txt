HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___, no significant PMH, p/w RLQ pain. Patient reports pain  onset was 2 days ago. It was gradual in nature and progressively  worsening now 5 out of 10 ___ out of 10 with movement.  Associated with nausea no vomiting no fevers or chills no change  in bowel or bladder habits. No testicular pain. No new exercises  over the past week. No history of any abdominal surgeries. No  chest pain or shortness of breath. No dysuria or discharge.   Past Medical History: ADD MDD Anxiety   Social History: ___ Family History: Noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, which could indicate several conditions like appendicitis, ovarian cysts, or kidney stones.  Given the nausea and worsening pain with movement, appendicitis is higher on the differential. I need to gather more information to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign,  rebound tenderness, abdominal guarding, auscultation of bowel sounds

ToolMessage:
"ADMISSION  ========================= Vitals: 98.0 89 118/75 16 100% RA GEN: A&O, NAD   HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist   CV: RRR, No M/G/R   PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R   ABD: Soft, nondistended, nontender, no rebound or guarding,  normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses   DRE: normal tone, no gross or occult blood   Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, nausea, and worsening pain with movement. While the initial physical exam did not reveal tenderness, rebound, or guarding, appendicitis is still a possibility as these signs can be subtle early in the disease course.  Given the concerning symptoms, I will order imaging to further evaluate for appendicitis and other potential causes of RLQ pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast matches closely with the available CTU (ABD/PEL) W/CONTRAST study. Here is the complete report:  CTU (ABD/PEL) W/CONTRAST (CTU):  EXAMINATION: CTU with contrast  TECHNIQUE: CTU: Multidetector CT of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired prior to and after intravenous contrast administration with the patient in prone position. The non-contrast scan was done with low radiation dose technique. The contrast scan was performed with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 542 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There are 2 hypodensities in segment IV of the liver with subtle peripheral enhancement, largest of which measures 1.2 x 1.2 cm which statistically represent hemangiomas given patient's age. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis. There is no hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions. There is no evidence of urothelial lesions. The distal ureters and bladder are unremarkable.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The ascending colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is abnormally dilated inflamed, with an appendicular with at the base, and dilated with stranding suggestive of micro perforation. The adjacent cecum and ileum are thickened and inflamed. There is no evidence of surrounding fluid collections.  PELVIS: There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with RLQ pain, nausea, and worsening pain with movement.  The physical exam was initially unremarkable, but the CT scan reveals an inflamed and dilated appendix with an appendicolith at the base and findings suggestive of microperforation. This confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
