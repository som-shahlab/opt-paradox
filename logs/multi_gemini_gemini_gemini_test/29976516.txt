HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ male without significant past medical history who  presents for elective ERCP/EUS. The patient was in his usual  state of health until approximately 6 months prior to admission  when he started to have intermittent  episodes of acute  epigastric pain (~ every ___ weeks), lasting minutes, associated  with severe discomfort, incapacitation, and pallor. There was no  clear association with activity or eating, but they seemed to  occur while on the train on his way to work. Over the ___  these episodes began to occur more frequently, and the duration  was occasionally longer (now hours). He was seen by his PCP (Dr. ___ in ___, who obtained blood work, H. pylori,  and an abdominal U/S that showed a dilated common bile duct to  1.5 cm with mild intrahepatic ductal dilation, a thick walled  gallbladder without stones, and artifact suggestive of  adenomyomatosis.   On ___, he was referred to see Dr. ___  surgery ___. ___), who wrote that his "symptoms are likely  from adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder," and that the "ductal  dilation deserves further workup prior to cholecystectomy." An  MRCP was obtained (___) that showed dilated common hepatic  ducts and common bile duct measuring 1.___ile  duct tapers abruptly proximal to the convergence with the  pancreatic duct to 5 mm.  He now presents for ERCP/EUS, showing dilated CBD (10mm)  suspicious for a choledochal cyst as well as a 1cm common  channel at the ampulla consistent with APBJ. A 1 mm polypoid  lesion was seen at the PD orrifice inside the common channel. He  underwent sphincterotomy and bx/brushings of abnormal CBD  mucosa.   After the procedure while in the PACU he developed epigastric  abdominal pain that is non-radiating and associated with nausea  without vomiting. ERCP fellow evaluated the patient and  recommended CT A/P, which is currently pending. On arrival to  the floor the patient reports that the pain has improved significantly from this afternoon, but has not completely  resolved and he continues to feel nauseated without vomiting.  ROS: He denies weight loss, night sweats, fevers, headaches, CP,  SOB, N/V, change in bowels or bladder habits, jaundice.  Pertinent positives and negatives as noted in the HPI; review of  systems otherwise negative.     Past Medical History: Essential hypertension Hyperlipidemia Nephrolithiasis Eosinophilia Prolonged bleeding time (details unclear)    Social History: ___ Family History: Father with stroke Mother with "meningitis"


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is presenting with intermittent episodes of acute epigastric pain, which have increased in frequency and duration over the past 6 months. Imaging has revealed a dilated common bile duct, a thick-walled gallbladder, and a possible choledochal cyst. The patient underwent ERCP/EUS with sphincterotomy and biopsy, after which he developed epigastric pain and nausea.  A CT A/P is pending. To fully assess the patient's condition and potential complications from the ERCP, I need more information.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show an elevated lipase, suggesting pancreatitis, which is a known complication of ERCP. The elevated white blood cell count may also be indicative of inflammation related to pancreatitis.  The slightly elevated glucose and BUN are likely not acutely concerning. I have enough information to make a recommendation.
