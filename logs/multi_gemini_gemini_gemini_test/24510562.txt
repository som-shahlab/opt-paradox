Pt was taken to the OR for an ex-lap and found to  have perforated viscous in the sigmoid area. Fibrinous exudate  in the left side was present c/w longstanding process. A  ___ pouch and LLQ colostomy was performed. The pt was  started on levaquin, flagyl and zosyn.  Postop the pt had persistent acidosis with a bicarb of 15,  lactate 4.8. He was started on a bicarb gtt. During the course  of the OSH stay the pt has been 9 liters positive. He remains  hypotensive on neo. Of note the pt drinks up to half-a-gallon a  day of whiskey. His last drink was 8 days ago.     Past Medical History: Alcohol abuse   PSH: ___ procedure   Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory

Thought: I need more information about the patient's current vital signs, including heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation.  I also need to know the patient's current white blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count to assess the severity of the sepsis and the potential for ongoing bleeding.  Knowing the patient's current electrolyte levels, including sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, and creatinine, will help me assess the patient's renal function and overall fluid and electrolyte balance.  A liver function panel will help me assess the patient's liver function in light of the elevated bilirubin on admission.  Finally, I need to know the patient's current medications and any allergies.

Thought: The patient is presenting with a perforated sigmoid colon status-post sigmoid colectomy and is currently septic and intubated.  The labs indicate macrocytic anemia, likely due to chronic alcohol abuse.  The patient also has an elevated creatinine and BUN, suggesting acute kidney injury, likely pre-renal given the patient's history of hypotension and fluid losses.  The low bicarbonate and elevated lactate are consistent with the patient's sepsis.  The elevated total and direct bilirubin suggest cholestasis or impaired liver function, possibly due to sepsis or underlying liver disease related to alcohol abuse.  The low albumin is concerning for malnutrition, which is common in patients with chronic alcohol abuse.  The patient's vital signs are crucial to assess the current state of his sepsis and guide management.  I also need to know the results of the blood cultures to identify the causative organism(s) and guide antibiotic therapy.

Thought: The patient is a male with a history of significant alcohol abuse presenting with a perforated sigmoid colon status-post sigmoid colectomy. He is currently septic, intubated, and has a history of hypotension requiring vasopressor support.  Labs reveal macrocytic anemia, acute kidney injury, low bicarbonate, elevated lactate, and elevated direct bilirubin.  Physical exam findings include tachycardia, clear breath sounds, a dusky and sunken colostomy, and peripheral edema.  The patient's clinical picture is consistent with severe sepsis secondary to a perforated sigmoid colon complicated by acute kidney injury and macrocytic anemia.  The dusky appearance of the colostomy raises concern for potential ischemic complications.  The patient's history of chronic alcohol abuse likely contributes to his malnutrition and may also play a role in his liver function abnormalities.  While blood cultures are pending, broad-spectrum antibiotics are appropriate.  Further management should focus on hemodynamic support, fluid resuscitation, and close monitoring for any signs of worsening sepsis or complications related to the colostomy.
