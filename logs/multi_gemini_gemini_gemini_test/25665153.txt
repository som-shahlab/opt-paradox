HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o female who developed primarily right  sided abdominal pain approximately 12 hrs prior to presentation,  followed by some nausea and nonbilious emesis.  She has not been  febrile but does endorse chills.  She has not had diarrhea or  constipation and is passing flatus. She denies any dysuria.  The  pain has gradually migrated towards her right lower quadrant in the past few hours, and is constant and sharp.  She has never  had pain like this before.   Past Medical History: Thyroidectomy for (malignant) nodule Insomnia Bipolar Disorder    Social History: ___ Family History: Non contributory.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating to the right lower quadrant, concerning for appendicitis.  Nausea, vomiting, and chills further support this possibility.  However, I need more information to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other differentials like ovarian cysts, kidney stones, or pelvic inflammatory disease.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign,  pelvic exam, vital signs

ToolMessage:
"On admission:  T: 98.2  P: 77  BP: 112/68  RR: 18  O2sat: 99% on RA General: awake, alert, oriented x 3 HEENT: NCAT, EOMI Heart: RRR, NMRG Lungs: CTAB, no respiratory distress Chest: non-tender Back: no vertebral tenderness Abdomen: soft, nondistended, mildly obese, quite tender to palpation locally over RLQ and R mid abdomen.  NO hernias or masses Pelvis: rectal exam refused Neuro: strength intact/symmetric Extremities: WWP, no CCE"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of right lower quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, and chills, along with localized tenderness at McBurney's point on physical exam, strongly suggests appendicitis.  While the patient is not febrile, a normal temperature does not rule out appendicitis.  The absence of rebound tenderness or guarding does not exclude the diagnosis either, as these signs may not be present in early appendicitis.  A pelvic exam was refused, which could have helped rule out gynecological causes, but given the other findings, appendicitis remains the most likely diagnosis. I will order a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications like perforation or abscess formation.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report from the available studies:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis following the administration of IV contrast. No oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were obtained.  FINDINGS: The visualized lung bases are clear. The visualized heart and pericardium are normal. The liver enhances normally and there are no focal liver lesions. There is no intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The gallbladder is normal. The spleen is normal. The pancreas is normal. The adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically. No bowel obstruction is seen. There are scattered diverticula in the transverse and descending colon. There is no evidence of diverticulitis. The appendix is enlarged with hyperemic walls and surrounding fat stranding consistent with ____. There is no extraluminal air or abscess. The appendix measures up to 1 cm in diameter. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  PELVIS: The rectum is unremarkable. The bladder and terminal ureters are normal. There is a 3-cm cystic structure in the right adnexa that is unchanged in appearance and size compared to CT abdomen and pelvis on ___. The left adnexa is unremarkable. There is an IUD in appropriate position within the uterus. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is no evidence of free fluid. The intra-abdominal and intrapelvic vasculature is patent. The bones are unremarkable."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT scan results confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. The CT scan shows an enlarged appendix with hyperemic walls and surrounding fat stranding, consistent with inflammation.  The presence of a 3-cm cystic structure in the right adnexa, while noted, is unchanged from a prior study and therefore unlikely to be the cause of her current symptoms.  The patient requires an appendectomy.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT scan results confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. The CT report describes an enlarged appendix with hyperemic walls and surrounding fat stranding, which are characteristic findings of appendicitis.  The presence of a right adnexal cyst is noted, but it is stable and unlikely to be the cause of her current symptoms.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Cyst (stable, likely incidental)
3. Kidney Stone (unlikely given lack of urinary symptoms and normal CT)
4. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (unlikely given lack of fever, vaginal discharge, and pelvic exam findings)
5. Diverticulitis (ruled out by CT scan)

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy. This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the severity of the inflammation and surgeon preference.  Preoperatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole).  Postoperatively, the patient should receive pain management, continue antibiotics as needed, and be monitored for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  The patient should be advised to follow up with her surgeon for wound care and to discuss the incidental ovarian cyst.
