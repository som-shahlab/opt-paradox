HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/ abd pain x3-4 days.  Progressive in nature.  Right abdomen, nonradiating, constant, sharp.  No fevers or chills, no N/V, no diarrhea, constipation, no anorexia    Past Medical History: Past Medical History:  chronic back pain, seasonal allergies  Past Surgical History:  microdiscectomy, tonsillectomy   Social History: ___ Family History: non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with progressive right abdominal pain of 3-4 days duration. The pain is sharp, constant, and non-radiating.  There are no associated symptoms such as fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, or anorexia.  Given the location and nature of the pain, appendicitis is a primary differential diagnosis.  Other possibilities include cholecystitis, kidney stones, or gynecological issues if the patient is female.  A physical exam is needed to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on palpation for tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, McBurney's point tenderness, Murphy's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign;  Vital signs including temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate

ToolMessage:
"afebrile GEN: A&O, NAD   HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist   CV: RRR, No M/G/R   PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R   ABD: Soft, nondistended, focally TTP just to Rt of umbilicus slightly toward McBurneys point, +rovsings with palpation to  left of umbilicus, +obturator, neg psoas, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses   DRE: deferred by pt  Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with progressive right lower quadrant abdominal pain, positive Rovsing's sign, and positive obturator sign.  These findings, combined with focal tenderness near McBurney's point, strongly suggest appendicitis. While the patient is afebrile and without rebound tenderness or guarding, these findings do not rule out appendicitis, which can present with varying degrees of severity.  Given the high suspicion for appendicitis, imaging is warranted to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST report that matches your request for CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast:  TECHNIQUE: Contiguous MDCT-acquired images from the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after uneventful administration of 130 cc of intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformats were reviewed.  CT ABDOMEN: Imaged lung bases are clear. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesion. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is unremarkable. The spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal. Loops of small bowel are normal in caliber. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically, without hydronephrosis. There is no free air or free fluid. There are few subcentimeter mesenteric lymph nodes without CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  CT PELVIS: The appendix is mildly dilated measuring up to 8 mm (300B:26) and demonstrates a mildly thick and enhancing wall. There is mild periappendiceal fat stranding (300B:26, 300B:27 and 2:55). There is no free air or free fluid. No focal fluid collection is noted. A few subcentimeter pelvic lymph nodes are seen without CT criteria for pathologic enlargement. The bladder, distal ureters are normal. There is no bowel obstruction. The aorta is normal in its course and caliber without aneurysm formation.  BONE WINDOWS: There is no osseous lesion concerning for infection or malignancy."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a 3-4 day history of progressive right lower quadrant pain. Physical exam findings include focal tenderness near McBurney's point, positive Rovsing's, and positive obturator sign.  The CT scan reveals a mildly dilated appendix with a thickened and enhancing wall, along with periappendiceal fat stranding. These findings confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Right Ovarian Cyst (if female)
4. Right Ureteral Stone
5. Cecal Diverticulitis

Treatment:  The patient should be admitted for laparoscopic appendectomy.  Administer intravenous fluids for hydration.  Provide pre-operative antibiotics such as Cefoxitin or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.  Post-operatively, continue intravenous fluids and antibiotics until the patient's clinical condition improves.
