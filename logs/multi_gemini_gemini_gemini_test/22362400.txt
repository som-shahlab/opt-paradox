HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with a hx of stage IIA triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast  s/p bilateral partial mastectomy and C3d1 of ddAC, who now presents with RLQ pain, nausea, and vomiting.  She reports that she was well until 3 AM this morning when she woke up with severe RLQ pain. She experienced this pain at rest and characterized it as constant, "sharp/throbbing", with radiation to her right flank in association with chills, diaphoresis, nausea and 1 episode of non-bloody emesis. She subsequently reported no appetite. Prior to being brought to the ED by ambulance she had a low-grade fever to 100.9 PO. She has not had a BM or passed flatus since last night. Otherwise she denies chest pain, shortness of breath, and/or dysuria.  Currently her pain persists yet she has had no further nausea or emesis since this morning. No history of similiar symptoms and no sick contacts.    Past Medical History: PMH: HTN, uterine fibroids, stage IIA triple negative invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast, L breast fibroadenoma, thyroid nodule, nephrolithiasis  PSH: Right axillary sentinel node biopsy ___ Dr. ___, Bilateral partial mastectomies with wire localization, left breast ___ Dr ___, Right ovarian cystectomy with bilateral ovarian cystotomies ___ Dr. ___, partial thyroidectomy for benign nodule (___), Evacuation of vaginal hematoma ___- Dr. ___, right sided electrohydraulic lithotripsy ___- Dr. ___, D&C ___ Dr. ___   Social History: ___ Family History: Adopted with no knowledge of family history.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of breast cancer and current presentation with RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills, several differential diagnoses need to be considered, including appendicitis, ovarian torsion, nephrolithiasis, and complications related to her prior cancer treatment.  A physical exam, laboratory tests, and imaging studies are necessary to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, and masses), pelvic exam, Murphy's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign, Rovsing's sign

ToolMessage:

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills raises concern for appendicitis, ovarian torsion, nephrolithiasis, or possible complications from her cancer history. The physical exam findings of slight incisional discomfort are non-specific.  Laboratory tests are needed to assess for infection and other abnormalities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show an elevated WBC with neutrophilia, which suggests an infectious or inflammatory process.  Moderate blood in the urine raises concern for kidney stones, especially given her history of nephrolithiasis.  However, the negative leukocytes and nitrites on urinalysis argue against a urinary tract infection.  The lack of CRP and CA-125 limits the ability to fully assess for inflammatory markers and ovarian pathology.  Abdominal imaging is necessary to visualize the abdominal organs and identify the cause of her symptoms.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast report, which matches your request:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis after administration of 130 cc of IV Omnipaque contrast. Oral contrast was administered. Axial images were interpreted in conjunction with coronal and sagittal reformats.  FINDINGS: The visualized heart is normal. There is small bibasilar atelectasis. No pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: The liver is normal without focal or diffuse abnormality. The gallbladder, intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly. The ureters are normal in course and caliber. 5.0 x 2.7 cm hypodense cystic lesion in the right anterior abdomen with local mass effect on the left hepatic lobe is unchanged and consistent with a lymphangioma or peritoneal inclusion cyst. The stomach is normal. The small and large bowel enhance homogeneously and have a normal course and caliber. The appendix is dilated to 11 mm with hyperemia and adjacent fat stranding, consistent with ____, predominantly involving the distal appendix. No substantial cecal edema. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The portal and intra-abdominal systemic vasculature are normal. No abdominal wall hernia, pneumoperitoneum, or free abdominal fluid.  PELVIS: The bladder and terminal ureters are normal. The uterus is unremarkable. No pelvic side-wall or inguinal lymphadenopathy. No free pelvic fluid or inguinal hernia.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No focal lytic or sclerotic lesion concerning for malignancy."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.  Her history includes breast cancer treated with surgery and chemotherapy.  Physical exam revealed slight incisional discomfort.  Lab results showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia and moderate blood in the urine.  The CT scan demonstrates appendicitis.  The other abdominal and pelvic organs are unremarkable.  Based on the totality of the findings, the diagnosis is acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with hyperemia and adjacent fat stranding.  The other visualized abdominal and pelvic organs are normal.  The cystic lesion is likely benign and unchanged from prior imaging.  The patient requires an appendectomy.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Torsion
3. Nephrolithiasis
4. Cancer recurrence/metastasis
5. Peritoneal inclusion cyst complication

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for laparoscopic appendectomy.  Administer IV fluids for hydration.  Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics with anaerobic coverage (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem, or piperacillin/tazobactam) to treat the infection.  Provide pain control with IV opioids as needed.  Monitor vital signs and clinical status.  Post-operative care should include wound care, pain management, and monitoring for complications such as infection or bleeding.
