HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ male with no significant past medical history who presents to ___ with crampy right lower quadrant abdominal pain.  The pain started yesterday afternoon shortly after eating a hamburger, and was progressively worsening over the course of the evening.  He tried simethicone without relief and continues to feel bloated.  The pain became worse with standing. It has not migrated. In the morning he felt some improvement and decided to go to work, however his pain worsened yet again.  He therefore presented to outpatient clinic and was recommended to go to the ED for further workup out of concern  for potential appendicitis.  In the ED today he continues to endorse right lower quadrant pain.  He has no nausea or vomiting and denies any fevers, chills, or dysuria.  He he feels hungry and has not eaten significantly today.  Last bowel movement was normal and occurred this morning.  He has no personal or family history of gastrointestinal cancer, IBD, or other GI disorders.  He has not had a colonoscopy.   Past Medical History: Past Medical History: None  Past Surgical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of right lower quadrant pain with worsening upon standing raises suspicion for appendicitis.  Other differentials include mesenteric adenitis, typhlitis, gastroenteritis, and other inflammatory processes. To narrow down the diagnosis, I need to assess for peritoneal signs, fever, and evaluate his blood counts.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on McBurney's point tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign;  Vital signs including temperature

ToolMessage:
"Admission  Vitals: T 98.8, HR 66, BP 117/85, RR 17, 99% RA GEN: A&O, NAD, well-nourished young man lying on stretcher HEENT: No scleral icterus CV: RRR PULM: Respirations non-labored ABD: Soft, nondistended, mild to moderately tender to palpation in RLQ, no rebound or guarding, some fullness RLQ EXT: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation is highly suspicious for appendicitis.  He has persistent RLQ pain, worse with standing, and now has tenderness in the RLQ on exam. While his vital signs are normal and there is no rebound or guarding, the lack of these findings does not rule out appendicitis.  Given the concern for appendicitis, imaging is warranted to evaluate the appendix.  A mild leukocytosis would further support the diagnosis, but is not required for diagnosis.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential

ToolMessage:
"I'll provide the CBC with differential results from the available laboratory data:  Complete Blood Count (CBC): - White Blood Cells: 15.8 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 5.04 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 15.3 g/dL - Hematocrit: 45.4% - MCV: 90.0 fL - MCH: 30.4 pg - MCHC: 33.7 g/dL - RDW: 11.6% - Platelet Count: 280.0 K/uL  Differential: - Neutrophils: 80.2% (Absolute: 12.7 K/uL) - Lymphocytes: 11.8% (Absolute: 1.87 K/uL) - Monocytes: 7.3% (Absolute: 1.15 K/uL) - Eosinophils: 0.1% (Absolute: 0.02 K/uL) - Basophils: 0.2% (Absolute: 0.03 K/uL) - Immature Granulocytes: 0.4%  All components of the requested CBC with differential are available in the laboratory data."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, exam findings, and elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia are highly suggestive of appendicitis.  Imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast report from the available imaging studies. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Single phase contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen following intravenous contrast administration. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 4.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 19.3 mGy (Body) DLP = 9.6 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 6.7 s, 52.6 cm; CTDIvol = 20.3 mGy (Body) DLP = 1,065.6 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 1,075 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. There is inflammation surrounding a diverticulum the at the cecum, with small foci of air which is more likely within the diverticulum though micro perforation is difficult to entirely exclude. There is secondary wall thickening of the cecum. There is minimal hyperemia at the base of the appendix, likely reactive. The appendix is otherwise normal.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is trace free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate and seminal vesicles are grossly unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy by size criteria. Multiple lymph nodes in the right lower quadrant measure up to 9 mm, likely reactive. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, initially worse with standing, and focal tenderness on exam.  The elevated WBC with neutrophilia suggests an inflammatory process.  The CT scan demonstrates inflammation surrounding a cecal diverticulum with small foci of air, concerning for possible microperforation.  There is also secondary wall thickening of the cecum. The appendix itself has minimal hyperemia at the base, likely reactive, and is otherwise normal.  The overall picture suggests acute cecal diverticulitis as the primary diagnosis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with RLQ pain concerning for appendicitis. Physical exam revealed tenderness in the RLQ.  CBC showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia.  CT scan showed inflammation surrounding a cecal diverticulum with small foci of air, concerning for possible microperforation.  The appendix itself was only minimally hyperemic at the base and otherwise normal.  The constellation of findings points to cecal diverticulitis as the most likely diagnosis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Cecal Diverticulitis
2. Appendicitis
3. Mesenteric Adenitis
4. Typhlitis
5. Gastroenteritis

Treatment:  The patient should be started on antibiotics covering gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, such as ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, or alternatively, amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin).  He should be kept NPO initially, and if tolerating a clear liquid diet, can be advanced to a regular diet as tolerated.  He should be instructed to return to the ED if his pain worsens, he develops a fever, or is unable to tolerate oral intake.  Surgical consultation is not immediately indicated but should be considered if the patient fails to improve with medical management or develops signs of peritonitis.  The patient should follow up with his primary care physician within a week and may benefit from a colonoscopy in the future to further evaluate the colon.
