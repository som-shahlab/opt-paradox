HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ F w/ 48 hrs of lower abd pain. Pain started ___, initially ___ umbilical then migrating to RL and LLQ. Pain is sharp, continuous, associated with nausea and vomiting, nonradiating. First episode. No fevers or chills. Passing flatus but no BM today.     Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, with pain migration from periumbilical to RLQ and LLQ.  This presentation is concerning for appendicitis, but other diagnoses such as diverticulitis, ovarian torsion, or inflammatory bowel disease need to be ruled out.  A physical exam is necessary to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure

ToolMessage:
"On admission:  99.2 75 83/41 18 100%  GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, nontender, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, concerning for appendicitis. While the physical exam did not reveal peritoneal signs, the patient's symptoms and the lack of bowel movement today still warrant further investigation.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast is necessary to evaluate for appendicitis, diverticulitis, or other causes of abdominal pain.  Laboratory tests are also needed to assess for infection and other abnormalities.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, urinalysis, CRP

ToolMessage:
"I'll help you retrieve the results for the requested tests:  For the CBC with differential: - White Blood Cells: 14.7 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 3.53 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 11.4 g/dL - Hematocrit: 34.8% - Platelet Count: 295.0 K/uL - Differential:   * Neutrophils: 91.8%   * Lymphocytes: 6.4%   * Monocytes: 1.7%   * Eosinophils: 0.0%   * Basophils: 0.1%  For the Urinalysis: - Color: Straw - Appearance: Hazy - pH: 6.0 units - Specific Gravity: 1.007 - Protein: Negative - Blood: Negative - Ketones: Negative - Nitrite: Negative - Leukocytes: Moderate - WBC: 6.0 #/hpf - RBC: 1.0 #/hpf - Epithelial Cells: 7.0 #/hpf - Bacteria: Few - Yeast: None  Regarding the CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel), only partial results are available: - Sodium: 137.0 mEq/L - Potassium: 4.2 mEq/L - Chloride: 101.0 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 27.0 mEq/L - Blood Urea Nitrogen: 16.0 mg/dL - Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL - Glucose: Negative Note: Some CMP components (liver function tests, calcium, protein, albumin) are not available in the provided data.  CRP (C-Reactive Protein) results are not available in the provided data."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and leukocytosis with neutrophilia. While the physical exam was benign, the patient's symptoms, lab findings, and lack of bowel movement suggest a potential intra-abdominal inflammatory process.  A CT scan is crucial to visualize the abdominal structures and identify the cause of the patient's symptoms.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired from the lung bases through the lesser trochanters following administration of both oral and intravenous contrast material. Multiplanar reformations were performed.  ABDOMEN CT: Aside from minimal bilateral dependent atelectasis, right greater than left, the visualized portions of the lungs are clear. A 4-mm hypodensity in the left hepatic lobe is too small to characterize but may be a simple cyst. Additional tiny hepatic hypodensities measuring up to 7 mm (2:27,34) are too small to characterize but are not definitely simple cysts given their irregular contours. The liver is otherwise unremarkable, without evidence of intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The portal vein is patent. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are unremarkable. The stomach is grossly normal. The small bowel and colon are unremarkable, without evidence of obstruction. The appendix is fluid filled and dilated to 9 mm (2:51). There is marked periappendiceal fat stranding without evidence of a fluid collection or free air to suggest perforation. A small quantity of free fluid is seen within the right lower abdominal quadrant. There are no pathologically enlarged abdominal lymph nodes. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber and its main branches are patent.  PELVIS CT: The bladder is grossly unremarkable. The uterus and adnexa are within normal limits. There is a small quantity of free fluid layering in the dependent portion of the pelvis. No pathologically enlarged pelvic lymph nodes are seen.  BONE WINDOW: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions are identified. Multilevel degenerative changes of the lumbar spine are noted."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with acute lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  The initial physical exam was benign.  Lab results showed leukocytosis and neutrophilia.  CT scan revealed a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding and a small amount of free fluid, consistent with acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and leukocytosis.  Initially, the physical exam was benign, but the patient's persistent symptoms, lab findings (leukocytosis with neutrophilia), and the CT findings of a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding and free fluid are highly suggestive of acute appendicitis. The absence of a fluid collection or free air suggests that the appendix is not perforated.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Diverticulitis
3. Ovarian Cyst
4. Mesenteric Adenitis
5. Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Treatment:  The patient should be admitted for intravenous fluids, pain management, and antibiotic therapy (e.g., a second-generation cephalosporin such as cefoxitin or cefuroxime plus metronidazole, or a third-generation cephalosporin such as ceftriaxone plus metronidazole).  A surgical consultation should be obtained for laparoscopic appendectomy.  The patient should be monitored for signs of perforation or worsening symptoms.  Post-operatively, the patient should receive continued antibiotic therapy and pain management.  The patient should be educated on wound care and follow-up appointments.
