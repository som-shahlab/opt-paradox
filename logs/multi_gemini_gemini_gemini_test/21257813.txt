HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ y/o female with a history of afib on coumadin who has had a  week long history of RUQ/chest pain. She intially presented to  ___ and was noted to have elevated LFTs and  bilirubin. U/S showed gallstones with mild wall edema, but a  normal CBD and biliary tree. She was started on IV cipro and  flagyl (at around 20:00 on ___ and transferred to ___ for  possible ERCP vs. surgery.     In the ED, initial VS were: 98.5 85 137/75 15 97% RA. In the ED  ERCP team was called, recommended MRCP and will eval patient in  AM. Labs significant for ALT 347, AST 393, lipase 1632, alk phos  395, Tbili 2.2, INR 3.1. Surgery also consulted, recommended  possible CCY after biliary tree cleared, and hold abx and  coumadin.     On arrival to the floor, patient denies any complaints, pain is  improved, denies nausea or other symptoms.     REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:   (+)   (-) fever, chills, night sweats, headache, vision changes,  rhinorrhea, congestion, sore throat, cough, shortness of breath,  chest pain, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  constipation, BRBPR, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria.    Past Medical History: Atrial Fibrillation   Basal Cell Cancer    PSH:tonsillectomy   eye surgery on the right side as a child   pilonidal cyst excision as teenager.      Social History: ___ Family History: Family history of heart disease. No known history of  malignancies.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a week-long history of RUQ/chest pain, elevated LFTs, and bilirubin. Initial ultrasound showed gallstones with mild wall edema, but a normal CBD and biliary tree. Given the elevated lipase, concerning for gallstone pancreatitis, and the patient's history of atrial fibrillation on coumadin (with an elevated INR), I need to assess her coagulation status and determine the severity of pancreatitis before considering further interventions like MRCP/ERCP.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has significantly elevated lipase confirming pancreatitis likely due to gallstones.  The PT and PTT are also elevated, consistent with her coumadin use, but need to be reversed given her acute illness.  Her potassium is also low. I have enough information to recommend a course of action.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought:This patient presents with a clinical picture consistent with gallstone pancreatitis, likely mild given the improvement in her abdominal pain. Her elevated lipase, along with the history of RUQ pain and gallstones on ultrasound, supports this diagnosis. The elevated LFTs and bilirubin suggest biliary obstruction, although the initial ultrasound did not show CBD dilation.  The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and current Coumadin therapy resulting in an elevated INR (3.1) and now further elevated PT and PTT are important considerations for management.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Gallstone pancreatitis
2. Acute Cholecystitis
3. Biliary colic
4. Drug-induced pancreatitis
5. Cholangitis

Treatment:
1. Hold Coumadin.
2. Administer Vitamin K to reverse Coumadin's effects.  Consider fresh frozen plasma or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) if rapid reversal is needed.
3. IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte management.  Address hypokalemia.
4. Pain management with IV opioids as needed.
5. Monitor vital signs, including oxygen saturation.
6. NPO initially, then advance diet as tolerated.
7. Continue to monitor lipase, LFTs, and bilirubin.
8. Once INR is therapeutic, obtain MRCP to evaluate the biliary tree for obstruction.
9. If MRCP shows CBD obstruction, ERCP with sphincterotomy and stone removal may be necessary.
10. Cholecystectomy should be considered after the pancreatitis resolves.
11. Restart Coumadin once pancreatitis resolves and patient is stable, if appropriate.  Consider alternative anticoagulation strategies.
