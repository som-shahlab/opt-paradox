HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ otherwise fairly healthy who presents w/ abdominal pain and  fevers. He has been treated with amoxicillin for a presumed URI  over the past week. Yesterday, he started to have crampy  abdominal pain, diffuse, and had ___ episodes of nausea and  vomiting. He also had multiple (~7) loose bowel movements  yesterday. Today, he was febrile to ___ and c/o significant  abdominal pain. He went to urgent care in ___, where  CXR showed free air, and he was transferred to ___ for further  management. Of note, he has never had a colonoscopy, although he  denies any recent changes in appetite or unintentional weight  loss. He has had a remote history of duodenal ulcer, treated  with tegamet and symptoms improved.    Past Medical History: PMH: none  PSH: none   Social History: ___ Family History: Noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and free air on CXR, which is highly suggestive of a perforated viscus. Given his history of duodenal ulcer, perforation is high on the differential.  However, other causes of perforation, such as appendicitis, diverticulitis, or even malignancy, cannot be ruled out without further investigation. I need to determine the location and cause of the perforation.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen/Pelvis with IV and oral contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast report that matches your request (though it notes oral contrast was not administered):  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 343 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN:  HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There are scattered subcentimeter hypodensities which are too small to characterize but likely represent hepatic cysts or biliary hamartomas. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There are a few subcentimeter scattered hypodensities seen throughout the kidneys, too small to fully characterize but likely representing renal cysts. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. There is a moderate amount of an intraperitoneal free air which is seen anterior to the liver as well as distributed throughout the abdomen and pelvis. The suspected site of perforation is from the sigmoid colon, likely in the setting of perforated ____. There is thickening of the sigmoid colon on series 2, image 70 with adjacent thickening of a small bowel segment which is likely reactive. Adjacent fat stranding in the perisigmoid region is noted though the site of perforation is not clearly identified. There is probable mild focal small bowel ileus adjacent to the sigmoid colon. No drainable fluid collection is seen. The IMV appears patent without evidence of thrombophlebitis. Colonic diverticulosis is noted diffusely. The remaining small bowel loops are prominent, measuring up to 2.9 cm (series 300b: Image 25), and fluid filled with normal enhancement. The ascending colon is fluid-filled.  PELVIS: Air locules are seen in the urinary bladder, likely due to recent instrumentation, however, in the absence of intervention, a colovesicular fistula is difficult to exclude. There is no distal hydroureter. There is some thickening of the bladder dome (Series 300b: Image 19), likely reactive due to the adjacent ____. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate is grossly unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 11:05 pm, 1 minutes after discovery of the findings."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the presence of free air and identifies the likely source as a perforated sigmoid diverticulitis.  The findings of sigmoid colon thickening, adjacent fat stranding, and the presence of diverticulosis support this diagnosis. While a colovesicular fistula is not definitively excluded, it is less likely given the lack of recent instrumentation. The patient's history of recent antibiotic use for a presumed URI may have masked some of the earlier symptoms of diverticulitis.  I have enough information to recommend a treatment plan.
