Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
HPI: Ms. ___ is a ___ yr old F with MDS, diagnosed on BM bx  showing excess blasts, and cytogenetic findings of translocation  3;5 and +WT-1 mutation with high risk of transformation to AML,  currently on C215 Decitabine who presents from clinic with  significant jaundice and direct bilirubinemia.   The patient reports developing nausea and vomiting last week  after eating large meal at ___ the nausea and vomiting  has persisted since. She was also noted to have yellow skin tone  in the clinic today but did not note this at home. She had no  emesis yesterday but 2 episodes on ___ and emesis again this  morning. No hematemesis, vomit is non-bilious, most c/w gastric  contents. Since yesterday taking mostly liquids as solids cause  abdominal discomfort. The pain is intermittent and epigastric.  Denies RUQ pain. She reports baseline constipation but has had  at least small BM most days and denies melena, hematochezia, or  mucoid stool. Reports fatigue of several weeks duration. Denies  Tylenol use or any recent changes to medications. She reports  approximately 2 episodes per month of over-eating followed by  abdominal pain and vomiting. She experiencing frequent  generalized abdominal pain which she attributes to long-standing  constipation, but the current episode is the worst she has  experienced.   Denies mouth sores, skin blisters, dermatomal pain. Also denies  fever/chills/sweats, cough, SOB, itchy skin or new rashes, or  dysuria.    ROS: A 10-point ROS was performed with pertinent findings noted  in HPI.  PAST ONCOLOGIC HISTORY: Dx ___. Patient had presented with  progressive fatigue and was found to have pancytopenia and  particularly significant anemia. A bone marrow was performed,  which showed multilineage dysplasia and a 3;5 translocation.   This was consistent with a myelodysplastic syndrome that may be  associated with more rapid progression towards AML.  The patient  was also on rapid heme panel found to have evidence of WT1  amplification. On C2 of Decitabine without major complications.      Past Medical History: MDS ___ - she was hospitalized for this at age ___ and ___, sees  counselor ___ in ___ Hx herniated disc   Social History: ___ Family History: She is adopted, she is not aware of any siblings and is not  aware of her biological parents health.

Thought: The patient presents with jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain. Given her history of MDS and current treatment with Decitabine, it's crucial to differentiate between potential causes of her symptoms, including drug-induced liver injury, disease progression, or other gastrointestinal issues.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show elevated lipase, suggesting pancreatitis.  The elevated bilirubin and transaminases could be due to extrahepatic biliary obstruction secondary to the pancreatitis.  While the patient denies RUQ pain, her epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting are consistent with pancreatitis.  I will order imaging to evaluate the pancreas and biliary tree.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast, MRCP

ToolMessage:
"From the requested imaging studies (CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast and MRCP), I can provide the CT abdomen/pelvis report from the available studies. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS W & W/O CONTRAST, ADDL SECTIONS:  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS W AND W/O CONTRAST, ADDL SECTIONS  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 1,020 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: There is bibasilar atelectasis. The heart is normal in size. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common bile duct measures up to 1 cm, also seen on abdominal ultrasound from 1 day prior. Minimal pneumobilia is seen, related to recent ERCP and sphincterotomy. The gallbladder is distended and contains multiple calculi. The wall is thickened. There is mild surrounding fat stranding with reactive wall thickening and inflammation of the hepatic flexure. Incidentally noted is fundal adenomyosis.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no substantial peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is normal.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus and adnexa are unremarkable. A small amount of pelvic free fluid is noted, most likely physiologic.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No significant atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Multilevel degenerative changes are noted throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar spine.  SOFT TISSUES: A fat containing umbilical hernia is noted.  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with Dr. ___, M.D. by ___ ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 2:43 ___, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings.  Note: The requested MRCP is not available in the provided list of imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan shows a distended gallbladder with multiple gallstones, thickened gallbladder wall, and surrounding fat stranding, suggestive of cholecystitis.  The common bile duct is dilated to 1 cm.  There is minimal pneumobilia related to a recent ERCP and sphincterotomy.  The pancreas appears normal, without evidence of pancreatitis. The patient's elevated lipase may be resolving, or it could be related to another process.  The elevated bilirubin and transaminases are likely due to the cholecystitis and possible common bile duct obstruction.  Given the patient's complex medical history, including MDS and recent Decitabine treatment, it's important to consider the possibility of infection or other complications.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**

5. Gastritis (less likely given the imaging and lab findings)

Treatment:  Given the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, the patient requires surgical consultation for possible cholecystectomy.  Supportive care should include intravenous fluids, pain management, and antiemetics.  A broad-spectrum antibiotic should be considered given the degree of inflammation around the gallbladder.
