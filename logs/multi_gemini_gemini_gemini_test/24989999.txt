HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ F w/ 1 day of RUQ abdominal pain radiating to back.  Her pain  started yesterday afternoon after eating a meatball sub and  potato chips.  Last night her symptoms progressed  and she had  ___ bouts of non-bloody, bilious emesis.  Of note, the patient  reports having similar, less severe symptoms about 3 times over  the past 6 months.  These symptoms occur after eating fatty  foods "like ___ fries, or potato chips".  She denies fevers,  chills or diarrhea   Past Medical History: anxiety, depression, chronic low back pain    Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain radiating to the back, bilious emesis, and a history of similar symptoms after eating fatty foods. This suggests biliary colic, possibly due to gallstones.  To confirm this, I need to assess for Murphy's sign and evaluate the patient's liver function.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Murphy's sign, palpation of the right upper quadrant

ToolMessage:
"VS: 97.6 50 158/69 20 100% 2L NC  Gen: NAD, AOx3 HEENT: MMM, EOM-I, non-icteric ___: reg Pulm: no resp distress Abd: S/ND/TTP RUQ + ___.  No rebound, no guarding. No palpable masses or hernias.  Obese. ___: no LLE"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RUQ pain radiating to the back, bilious emesis worsened by fatty foods, and a positive Murphy's sign strongly suggests cholecystitis.  While her vital signs are stable and she does not appear acutely ill, imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications like choledocholithiasis or gallstone pancreatitis.  Liver function tests will also help assess the impact on liver function and rule out other potential causes of her symptoms.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, lipase, amylase

ToolMessage:
"Here are the results for the requested tests:  - AST (Aspartate Aminotransferase): 30.0 IU/L - ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase): 21.0 IU/L - Alkaline Phosphatase: 69.0 IU/L - Total Bilirubin: 0.3 mg/dL - Direct Bilirubin: Not available in the lab results - Lipase: 28.0 IU/L - Amylase: Not available in the lab results  All available values appear to be within normal ranges. Two of the requested tests (Direct Bilirubin and Amylase) were not included in the provided laboratory results."

InterpretationMessage:
Lab Interpretation: {
    "AST": {"value": 30.0, "interpretation": "normal"},
    "ALT": {"value": 21.0, "interpretation": "normal"},
    "Alkaline Phosphatase": {"value": 69.0, "interpretation": "normal"},
    "Total Bilirubin": {"value": 0.3, "interpretation": "normal"},
    "Lipase": {"value": 28.0, "interpretation": "normal"}
}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including RUQ pain, bilious emesis exacerbated by fatty foods, a positive Murphy's sign, and normal liver function tests and lipase, is highly suggestive of cholecystitis.  An ultrasound is crucial to visualize the gallbladder and confirm the presence of gallstones or other gallbladder pathology.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Right upper quadrant ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound): TECHNIQUE: Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant. FINDINGS: The liver is normal in echogenicity and contour without focal liver lesion. Mild intrahepatic biliary dilation is seen. The CBD measures up to 5 mm. The gallbladder is mildly distended and contains sludge. A stone is present within the gallbladder neck which does not appear to move with repositioning. The gallbladder wall is not thickened. The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The spleen is not enlarged measuring 11.4 cm. Limited views of the pancreas are unremarkable."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RUQ pain radiating to the back, bilious emesis worsened by fatty foods, a positive Murphy's sign, and the ultrasound findings of sludge and a stone in the gallbladder neck confirm the diagnosis of cholecystitis. The mildly dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts and normal CBD suggest the stone is likely impacting the cystic duct and not causing significant obstruction of the common bile duct.  The normal liver function tests and lipase further support this. The patient's history of similar, less severe episodes after eating fatty foods suggests chronic cholecystitis with intermittent exacerbations.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RUQ pain radiating to the back, bilious emesis worsened by fatty foods, a positive Murphy's sign, and the ultrasound findings of a stone in the gallbladder neck along with mild intrahepatic biliary dilation confirms the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.  The normal liver function tests and lipase suggest no significant liver or pancreatic involvement at this time.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Cholecystitis
2. Biliary Colic
3. Choledocholithiasis
4. Gallstone Pancreatitis
5. Gastritis

Treatment:  The patient requires admission for pain management, intravenous fluids, and antibiotics.  A surgical consultation should be obtained for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  NPO status initially, then a gradual progression to a low-fat diet.  Pain control can be achieved with IV opioids initially, transitioning to oral analgesics as tolerated.  Intravenous antibiotics such as ceftriaxone and metronidazole should be initiated to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.  Post-operatively, the patient should be monitored for complications such as bleeding, infection, or bile leak.  Discharge instructions should include pain management, wound care, and dietary recommendations.  Follow-up with the surgeon should be arranged within 1-2 weeks.
