HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr ___ is a ___, no significant PMH, presented to urgent care  today with CC of RLQ abdominal pain. He describe a periumbilical  pain, ___, now migrated to RLQ with subsiding severity.  Associated symptoms include chills, and po intolerance. Labs at  urgent care is significant for WBC of 13 and CT scan shows dilated tip of appendix that is hyperemic without  definitive surrounding inflammation.   ROS:   (+) per HPI   (-) Denies fevers, night sweats, unexplained weight loss,  fatigue/malaise/lethargy, changes in appetite, trouble with  sleep, pruritis, jaundice, rashes, bleeding, easy bruising,  headache, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, weakness, paresthesias,  nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, bloating, cramping, melena,  BRBPR, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, edema,  urinary frequency, urgency     Past Medical History: Past Medical History:  Sinusitis   Past Surgical History:  Sinus surgery (remote)   Social History: ___ Family History: Noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ abdominal pain, initially periumbilical, which is a classic presentation for appendicitis.  The elevated WBC count and the CT findings of a dilated, hyperemic appendix tip further support this. However, the lack of definitive surrounding inflammation on the CT makes the diagnosis less certain.  A physical exam could help clarify the diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign, Rebound tenderness

ToolMessage:
"Physical Exam at admission:   Vitals:  98.5 66 116/78 14 97% RA GEN: A&O, NAD   HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist   CV: RRR, No M/G/R   PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R   ABD: Soft, nondistended, TTP RLQ, no rebound or guarding. Negative rovsings, psoas, obturator. Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including periumbilical pain migrating to the RLQ, chills, and poor oral intake, strongly suggests appendicitis.  The elevated WBC count and the CT findings of a dilated, hyperemic appendix tip further support this diagnosis. While the CT doesn't show definitive surrounding inflammation, the physical exam findings of RLQ tenderness solidify the diagnosis of appendicitis.  Given the patient's presentation and the totality of the findings, I am confident in the diagnosis of appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""
