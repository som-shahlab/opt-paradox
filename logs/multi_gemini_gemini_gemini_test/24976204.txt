HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr ___ is a ___ who presents complaining of severe RUQ pain  since last evening.  He states that he had similar pain 4 nights  ago that only lasted for a few hours and then resolved, was not  associated with nausea or vomiting.  Then last evening a few  hours after dinner he felt the pain return, severe and diffuse  upper abdomen, progressing to more diffuse abdomen and raditaing  across his back.  He says he had mild nausea without emesis, no  chest pain or shortness or breath.  Last bowel movement was last  evening after the pain had started, normal, no blood, no  diarrhea.  Can not say if he has passed gas.  Otherwise has not  had this before, no history of gallstones.    Past Medical History: Asthma, HTN, Basal cell carcinoma   Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Severe RUQ pain suggests several possibilities, including biliary colic, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or hepatitis.  The radiating back pain is concerning and could indicate more serious conditions like a perforated ulcer or pancreatitis.  The lack of fever argues against cholangitis.  Given the recurrence and worsening of pain, it's crucial to rule out life-threatening conditions first.  I need more information to narrow down the diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with severe RUQ pain radiating to the back, with significantly elevated lipase and amylase, indicating acute pancreatitis.  The elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST) and bilirubin suggest possible biliary involvement, although the alkaline phosphatase is not significantly elevated. The urine findings, including proteinuria, ketonuria, and hematuria, are concerning and warrant further investigation but could be related to dehydration or other factors. The patient's history of similar pain resolving spontaneously a few days prior may represent an earlier episode of pancreatitis.  I have enough information to make a presumptive diagnosis.
