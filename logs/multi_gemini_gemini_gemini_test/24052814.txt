HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old male who presents with RUQ pain that  started this morning after breakfast associate with nausea and  vomiting. This is not associated with fever, or chills.  He had a similar self  limiting episode one week previously. He does not complain of  dysuria, shoulder pain, jaundice, change in color of  urine/stool.    Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: No history of gallbladder disease.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's RUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting suggest a potential biliary issue like cholecystitis or choledocholithiasis.  The prior similar episode makes these diagnoses more likely.  To differentiate, I need to assess for signs of inflammation and biliary obstruction. I also need to know the patient's age and social history (specifically alcohol use and smoking status) to assess risk factors.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Murphy's sign, assessment for jaundice, vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure)

ToolMessage:
"On admission:  Vitals: Temp 98.1 HR 66 BP 154/90 RR 18 100% ra  GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender RUQ, + ___, no rebound or guarding.  normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses DRE: normal tone, no gross or occult blood Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RUQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and a positive Murphy's sign strongly suggests cholecystitis.  The absence of fever, jaundice, and the normal vital signs point towards acute cholecystitis without significant systemic involvement or biliary obstruction. The patient's age and social history (missing from the initial information) would help complete the clinical picture and assess risk factors. However, the current information is sufficient to suggest a likely diagnosis.
Action: done
