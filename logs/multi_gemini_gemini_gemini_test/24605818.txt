HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ is a ___ year old male without PMHx who presented to ED this morning with 24hr of RLQ pain. He reported pain started and stays in RLQ. Denied any fever, chills. He endorsed nausea but denied emesis. Patient denied any similar pain in the past.  ROS: (+) per HPI, positive anorexia (-) Denies fevers chills, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue/malaise/lethargy,  trouble with sleep, pruritis, jaundice, rashes, bleeding, easy bruising, headache, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, weakness, paresthesias, vomiting, hematemesis, bloating, cramping, melena, BRBPR, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, edema, urinary frequency, urgency    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: None  Past Surgical History: None  Medications: None  Allergies: NKDA  Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute RLQ pain, which could indicate several conditions like appendicitis, diverticulitis, or kidney stones.  Nausea and anorexia further suggest an abdominal pathology.  I need to gather more information to narrow down the diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, and Rovsing's sign), psoas sign, obturator sign, rectal exam

ToolMessage:
"On admission:   Vitals: 99.1 70 139/76 26 100%   GEN: A&Ox3, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender to RLQ, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, anorexia, and tenderness in the RLQ on physical exam raises suspicion for appendicitis.  While the absence of rebound tenderness and guarding lowers the likelihood, it doesn't rule it out.  Given the concerning presentation, I would order imaging to evaluate for appendicitis and other possible causes of RLQ pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis. Oral and 100 mL of Omnipaque IV contrast were administered. Axial images were interpreted in conjunction with sagittal and coronal reformats. DLP: 287 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  ABDOMEN: The visualized heart is normal. The lung bases are clear. The pericardium and pleura are intact without effusion. The liver is unremarkable without focal or diffuse abnormality. The gallbladder, intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts, pancreas, spleen, bilateral adrenal glands, and bilateral kidneys are normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly. The ureters are normal in course and caliber. The esophagus is normal. The stomach contains large amount of oral contrast. The small and large bowel are normal in course and caliber. The appendix is dilated to 1.3 cm, fluid filled, and hyperemic. A rounded calcified structure with a central lucency is present at the tip of the appendix. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. The portal and intra-abdominal systemic vasculature are normal. No abdominal wall hernia, free abdominal fluid, or free abdominal air.  PELVIS: The bladder and terminal ureters are normal. The prostate is unremarkable. No pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Small free pelvic fluid. No inguinal hernia.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No focal lytic or sclerotic lesions concerning for malignancy. Bilateral L5 spondylolysis."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, nausea, anorexia, and RLQ tenderness, combined with the CT findings of a dilated, fluid-filled, and hyperemic appendix with a calcified structure at the tip (likely an appendicolith) strongly suggests appendicitis. The presence of small free pelvic fluid further supports this diagnosis.  The other abdominal and pelvic organs appear normal on CT.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, nausea, anorexia, and RLQ tenderness, combined with the CT findings of a dilated, fluid-filled, and hyperemic appendix with a calcified structure at the tip (likely an appendicolith) strongly suggests appendicitis. The presence of a small amount of free pelvic fluid further supports this diagnosis.  The spondylolysis is an incidental finding and unrelated to the current presentation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Diverticulitis (less likely given the location of pain and CT findings)
3. Kidney stone (less likely given the lack of flank pain and normal kidneys on CT)
4. Ovarian torsion (less likely in a male patient)
5. Epiploic appendagitis (less likely given the CT findings)

Treatment:  The patient should be started on IV fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Piperacillin/Tazobactam or Cefoxitin plus Metronidazole).  A surgical consultation should be obtained for an appendectomy.  Laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred approach.  The patient should be monitored for complications such as perforation or abscess formation.
