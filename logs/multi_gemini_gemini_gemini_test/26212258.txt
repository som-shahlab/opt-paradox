HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ female with no significant past medical history presenting with abdominal pain. Patient states that she started having  periumbilical pain yesterday evening. This morning woke up and pain felt more severe and was now localized to her RLQ. She endorses nausea and vomiting (x1) this morning. Denies any fevers, chills, or diarrhea. Does endorse anorexia and last ate yesterday evening. The patient otherwise has no other complaints and no history of prior abdominal surgeries.    Past Medical History: PMHx: none  PSHx: none   Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female presenting with abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. This presentation is concerning for appendicitis.  I need to gather more information to confirm this suspicion and rule out other differentials like ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, or kidney stones.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign, vital signs (temperature, heart rate, blood pressure), abdominal auscultation for bowel sounds

ToolMessage:
"Vitals: T 98.4, HR 93, BP 110/70, RR 14 100% RA  Gen: well appearing, NAD CV: RRR, palpable peripheral pulses P: nonlabored breathing on room air GI: soft, nondistended; +TTP in RLQ; +rebound; +voluntary guarding Ext: WWP, no CCE"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and positive McBurney's point tenderness, rebound tenderness, and voluntary guarding strongly suggests appendicitis.  The normal vital signs and lack of fever argue against a more severe or widespread infection at this time. While her presentation is highly suggestive of appendicitis, I would like to obtain imaging to confirm the diagnosis before surgical consultation.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast report. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 321 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: There is a 12 mm hypodensity in the lower pole of the right kidney which is incompletely characterized but likely represents a renal cyst. Otherwise, the kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of concerning focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: There is a dilated appendix measuring approximately 9 mm in diameter with a tiny luminal appendicolith and periappendiceal fat stranding is consistent with ____ (601b:20). There is adjacent inflammation and bowel wall thickening of the base of the cecum. There is no evidence of extraluminal air or a drainable fluid collection. There are two short segment intussusceptions involving jejunal loops in the mid abdomen which do not demonstrate a lead point or evidence of obstruction, likely transient in etiology (601b:17; 2:40,45). Otherwise, the remaining small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The stomach is unremarkable. The colon and rectum are within normal limits.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is small amount of free fluid in the pelvis within physiologic range.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus and bilateral adnexae are within normal limits.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with an appendicolith and periappendiceal fat stranding. The incidental findings of a small renal cyst and transient jejunal intussusceptions are noted but not clinically relevant at this time.  I have enough information to recommend a surgical consult.

Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with an appendicolith and periappendiceal fat stranding. The incidental findings of a small renal cyst and transient jejunal intussusceptions are not clinically significant in this context.  The patient requires an appendectomy.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian torsion
3. Ectopic pregnancy
4. Kidney stones
5. Mesenteric adenitis

Treatment:  Consult surgery for laparoscopic appendectomy.  Start the patient on IV fluids for hydration and administer IV antibiotics with gram-negative and anaerobic coverage (e.g., Cefoxitin, or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole) to prevent post-operative infection.  Provide pain management with IV opioids as needed.  Post-operatively, continue IV antibiotics until the patient is afebrile, tolerating a regular diet, and ambulating.  Discharge the patient with instructions for wound care and pain management.  Follow-up with the patient in 1-2 weeks to assess healing and remove any skin sutures/staples.
