InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis s/p colectomy with J-pouch and two previous episodes of RUQ pain consistent with cholelithiasis.  She now presents with similar RUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting.  A HIDA scan was previously recommended but not obtained.  Given her history and current symptoms, it's important to evaluate for cholecystitis and other potential causes of her RUQ pain.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs are normal, which lowers the suspicion for acute cholecystitis, but does not rule it out.  Her history is suggestive of biliary colic.  A HIDA scan would be helpful to assess gallbladder function and confirm the suspected diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: HIDA scan with CCK

ToolMessage:
"The requested HIDA scan with CCK is not available in the provided list of imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs are normal, which lowers the suspicion for acute cholecystitis, but does not rule it out. Her history is suggestive of biliary colic.  Since a HIDA scan is not available, an abdominal ultrasound would be the next best step to evaluate for gallstones and signs of cholecystitis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) (Ultrasound):  TECHNIQUE: Gray scale and Doppler ultrasound images of the abdomen were obtained.  FINDINGS: The liver shows no evidence of focal lesions or textural abnormality. There is no evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The common bile duct measures up to 7 mm, not significantly changed from the prior study. A 6 mm nonobstructing stone is seen within the common bile duct. The gallbladder is distended with multiple stones with pericholecystic fluid. Sonographic ___ sign is positive. Limited views of the body of the pancreas are unremarkable. The head and tail of the pancreas are not well visualized due to overlying gas."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of recurrent RUQ pain consistent with cholelithiasis.  Her labs are normal, but the abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones, pericholecystic fluid, a positive sonographic Murphy's sign, and a 6mm non-obstructing stone in the common bile duct.  These findings are consistent with cholecystitis.  The presence of a common bile duct stone raises the possibility of choledocholithiasis as well.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of recurrent RUQ pain consistent with biliary colic.  She now presents with another episode of similar pain.  Her labs are normal.  The abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones, pericholecystic fluid, and a positive sonographic Murphy's sign, which are highly suggestive of cholecystitis.  A small non-obstructing stone is also seen in the common bile duct.  Given her recurrent symptoms and ultrasound findings, cholecystectomy is indicated.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Chronic cholecystitis
2. Cholelithiasis
3. Biliary colic
4. Choledocholithiasis (non-obstructing)
5. Pancreatitis (less likely given normal lipase and amylase)

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Discuss the small common bile duct stone with the surgeon.  If the stone is not causing obstruction and the patient is asymptomatic from it, it can often be managed expectantly.  Pain control with NSAIDs or opioids as needed.  Antiemetics for nausea and vomiting.  Clear liquid diet until symptoms improve.
