HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old man with a history of pancreatic  cancer s/p CBD stent placement in ___ with subsequent  revisions in ___ and ___ who presents from OSH with  malaise and mild abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with  pancreatic cancer in early ___ and underwent an attempted  Whipple in ___ that was aborted when metastatic disease to  the liver was discovered at laparotomy. He started chemotherapy  shortly thereafter, and reports feeling malaise shortly after  his chemotherapy sessions, the most recent of which was on  ___. He has also been feeling increasingly weak since  ___, sometimes tiring after 10 minutes of walking. He denies  accompanying chest pain, dizziness, lightheadedness, orthopea,  or PND.  The weekend prior to admission, the patient had poor appetite  and did not eat or drink very much. He syncopized twice, and  each episode was preceded by presyncope. He reports brief LOC  but no head strike or abnormal movements. He also reports  measuring a low blood pressure at home to 85/61 (baseline in the  110s systolic) though was asymptomatic. His wife grew worried  given apparently increasing weakness and took him to ___  ___ ED. At ___, he received 5L NS, 2U  PRBCs, and vanc/cefepime. He was in Afib with RVR and was  started on a ditliazem drip at 10mg/hr. He was given vancomycin  and cefepime and transferred to ___.  In the ED, initial VS were: T:100.2 HR:150 BP:113/73 RR:18  O2:97%. A CTA was negative for PE and showed numerous lung and  liver lesion and an air-filled strucutre at the anterior border  of the liver that could represent gallbladder with pneumobilia,  bowel, or a necrotic lesion. A RUQ u/s showed a CBD dilated to  8-11mm and the same incompletely characterized air-filled  structure at the anterior border of the liver. His Afib with RVR  broke with the diltiazem gtt and he was given tylenol 1g for  pain.  On arrival to the MICU, patient's VS were 99.4 134 ___  96%/RA. He denied dizziness, lightheadedness, cheset pain, or  SOB.   Past Medical History: - Type II diabetes mellitus  - Atrial fibrillation: per patient report, developed ___ years  ago, resolved ___ years ago after switching jobs   Social History: ___ Family History: No cancer. Otherwise, nonncontributory.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with malaise, abdominal pain, and syncope.  Given his history of pancreatic cancer with liver metastases and recent chemotherapy, several possibilities need to be considered, including infection, dehydration, adverse effects of chemotherapy, disease progression, and cardiac arrhythmias.  The patient's recent syncopal episodes and hypotension raise concern for dehydration and/or cardiac arrhythmia. The patient also received antibiotics at the outside hospital, suggesting concern for infection. To further evaluate these possibilities, I need more information about his current status and laboratory results.

Thought: The patient's labs show hyperglycemia, likely due to uncontrolled diabetes, which may be contributing to his malaise and dehydration.  He also has a high BUN, suggesting dehydration, which is consistent with his history of poor oral intake and hypotension.  His elevated total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase are consistent with biliary obstruction, possibly related to his pancreatic cancer and CBD stent.  The low albumin is concerning for malnutrition, which is common in patients with advanced cancer.  The low calcium may be contributing to his weakness.  The high RDW and low hemoglobin suggest some degree of anemia, which could also be contributing to his weakness and fatigue.  I will request troponin and BNP to further evaluate his cardiac function, given his history of atrial fibrillation and syncope.  I also want blood cultures to assess for infection, given his recent antibiotic treatment.
