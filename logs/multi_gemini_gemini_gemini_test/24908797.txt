HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with known cholelithiasis and a history of intermittent  epigastric pain presents with 6-hours of RUQ/epigastric pain  accompanied by nausea/vomiting. Pt has been evaluated by her PCP  several times over the past few months for intermittent  epigastric pain that was initially felt to be related to  esophageal spasm. She recently underwent RUQ ultrasound, which  she reports to have shown cholelithiasis. She is currently  scheduled for outpatient surgical evaluation for  cholecystectomy. Last evening, however, her pain returned. She  describes a severe pain in her RUQ/epigastrium with radiation  through to her right back, similar to other episodes she has  had. However, this time she had nausea and multiple bouts of  nonbloody, nonbilious emesis and chills. She has noted loose,  light colored stools over the recent days as well.  She  otherwise denies fevers, recent travel, or sick contacts. As she  reflects on the recent months, even between exacerbations she  cannot recall a time where she was completely pain free with no  discomfort.      Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Seasonal allergies, Allergy-induced asthma, Rosacea, Hx  obstructing renal calculi s/p lithotripsy/stent placement,  Cholelithiasis  Past Surgical History: Hysteroscopy w/ polypectomy, Lap R ovarian endometrioma  excision, Rhinoplasty, Lithotripsy/ureteral dilation and ureteral stent  placement (___)    Social History: ___ Family History: Non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation suggests a possible biliary obstruction or other related complications like cholecystitis or cholangitis.  Given her history of cholelithiasis and the new onset of severe, persistent pain, vomiting, and chills, it's crucial to assess for signs of infection, biliary obstruction, and other potential causes of abdominal pain.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count and elevated lipase, which suggests a possible inflammatory process and pancreatic involvement.  While some labs are still pending (amylase, direct bilirubin, GGT, lactate), the current findings combined with the patient's history and symptoms warrant imaging to assess the biliary tree and pancreas.
Action: imaging
Action Input: RUQ Ultrasound, MRCP

ToolMessage:
"Among the requested imaging studies (RUQ Ultrasound and MRCP), I can provide the RUQ (Right Upper Quadrant) Ultrasound report, which is available as \"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)\":  LIVER AND GALLBLADDER ULTRASOUND: The liver appears normal in echotexture. No focal liver lesions identified. The common bile duct measures 0.6 cm. The gallbladder appears unremarkable. A gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder is noted which did not move with position change. A second area with shadowing in the vicinity of the gallbladder neck likely represents air in the duodenal bulb, less likely a shadowing gallstone. The visualized pancreas appears unremarkable. The main portal vein is patent. There is no free fluid within the right upper quadrant.  The MRCP is not available in the list of available imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a history of cholelithiasis and intermittent epigastric pain, now with a 6-hour episode of severe RUQ/epigastric pain radiating to the back, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and chills.  The RUQ ultrasound confirms the presence of a gallstone in the gallbladder neck, which didn't move with position change.  Lab results show elevated white blood cells and lipase, indicating an inflammatory process and possible pancreatic involvement.  The combination of these findings points towards acute cholecystitis with possible biliary obstruction. While an MRCP would be helpful to fully evaluate the biliary tree, the current information is sufficient to make a presumptive diagnosis and initiate treatment.
