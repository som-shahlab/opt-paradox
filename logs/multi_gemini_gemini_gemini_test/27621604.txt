HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ hx of biliary colic now presents with abdominal pain.  Patient had one episode of biliary colic in ___ and was  referred for surgical evaluation at that time, however, declined  surgery given social circumstances. Since then she had one  additional episode of colic that resolved until ___ night  when she describes increasing crampy right upper quadrant and  epigastric pain radiating to back. Patient reports that she was  seen in ___ and discharged twice since then with pain and  anti-nausea medications with recommendation to follow up with a  surgeon. Last night after discharge from ___ had tortolleni  with cheese and then pain came back accompanied by nausea. She  also felt weak. Denies fevers or chills. No jaundice. No weight  loss. Social situation still insecure but agrees to have surgery  at this time as pain is making her miserable.    Past Medical History: PMH: thyroid ca s/p thyroidectomy, prior SBOs managed conservatively, htn, GERD, osteoporosis, h.pylori, anxiety, dementia, nephrolithiasis, gallstones, hematuria, incidentally noticed side branch IPMN, benign right hepatic duct stricture   PSH: total thyroidectomy, total hysterectomy, ex-lap for bowel obstruction following hysterectomy in ___    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of biliary colic and gallstones, and now presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and weakness.  Given the history and current symptoms, this could indicate a recurrence of biliary colic, cholecystitis, or other related complications like cholangitis or pancreatitis. I need to gather more information to narrow down the possibilities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results, including lipase, ALT/AST, and bilirubin are within normal limits, which reduces the likelihood of serious complications like pancreatitis or cholangitis. However, the slightly elevated white blood cell count could suggest inflammation.  Combined with the patient's history of biliary colic, gallstones, and the current symptoms, cholecystitis remains a strong possibility. An abdominal ultrasound would help visualize the gallbladder and surrounding structures to confirm this suspicion.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested abdominal ultrasound matches the available LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) study. Here is the complete report:  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN):  TECHNIQUE: Grey scale and color Doppler ultrasound images of the abdomen were obtained.  FINDINGS: LIVER: The hepatic parenchyma appears within normal limits. The contour of the liver is smooth. There is a hyperechoic lesion in segment 8 of the liver compatible with known hemangioma. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is no ascites.  BILE DUCTS: There is mild intrahepatic biliary dilation. The CHD measures 3 mm.  GALLBLADDER: The gallbladder is markedly distended and contains sludge and stones. There is a stone at the gallbladder neck that is difficult to assess for mobility. ___ sign difficult to assess given premedication of the patient. The gallbladder wall appears slightly thickened.  PANCREAS: The imaged portion of the pancreas appears within normal limits, without masses or pancreatic ductal dilation, with portions of the pancreatic tail obscured by overlying bowel gas.  SPLEEN: Normal echogenicity, measuring 7.9 cm.  KIDNEYS: Limited views of the kidneys show no hydronephrosis.  RETROPERITONEUM: The visualized portions of aorta and IVC are within normal limits.  NOTIFICATION: 1. ."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's history, symptoms, lab results, and the abdominal ultrasound findings point towards a diagnosis of cholecystitis. The ultrasound shows a distended gallbladder with sludge and stones, a stone at the gallbladder neck, and a slightly thickened gallbladder wall.  The mild intrahepatic biliary dilation could be due to the stone at the neck obstructing the cystic duct.  While the patient's pain is making her miserable and she is now willing to undergo surgery, her complex medical history (thyroid cancer, prior SBOs, hypertension, GERD, osteoporosis, h.pylori, anxiety, dementia, nephrolithiasis, hematuria, and incidentally noted IPMN) requires careful consideration for surgical planning and risk assessment.
