HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This is a ___ y/o F who presents with R flank pain starting 4  days ago. The pain occurred acutely, sharp in nature, after  eating.  Over the next three days, the pain decreased after the  patient ingested sips of water and flat ginger ale. However,  yesterday evening, she had toast, which brought back the pain,  with even more severity. She was taken to ___ via  EMS for assessment. CT ABD was concerning for choleduodenal  fistula. The patient was given Levaquin and transferred to ___  for further assessment and care. The patient denies nausea/vomiting, fevers/chills, or constipation. Since the pain  episode began, the patient states diarrhea.  She claims having a  "gallbladder attack" over ___ years ago, with no episodes since  then.    Past Medical History: PMH: hypothyroidism (___'s thyroiditis), HTN, osteopenia,  asthma  PSH: open hysterectomy, right oophorectomy, appendectomy (during  hysterectomy), carpal tunnel release, B/L hip and knee  replacements    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother with history of biliary disease


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of right flank pain, prior gallbladder attack, recent CT ABD concerning for choleduodenal fistula, and diarrhea, it's crucial to gather more information to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.  Specifically, I need to understand the patient's current pain level, vital signs, and laboratory results to assess the severity of her condition and potential complications like infection or inflammation.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC, CMP, lipase, amylase, urinalysis

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show elevated total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT, which, combined with the right flank pain, history of gallbladder attack, and CT findings suggestive of choleduodenal fistula, strongly points towards biliary disease. The slightly elevated neutrophils and BUN could indicate dehydration or a mild inflammatory response.  The urinalysis is largely unremarkable.  The absence of significantly elevated lipase and amylase makes pancreatitis less likely.  I have enough information to make a recommendation.
