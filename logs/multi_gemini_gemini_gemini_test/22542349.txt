HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ old man who presented to ___ ED  previously several hours ago after developing abdominal pain. He  states that he had a regular meal for dinner, then around  12:30AM on ___, began to develop abdominal pain. This  started in his central mid-abdomen, and then radiated both upwards and downwards. He tried to take some sprite to control  the pain, but this did not help. He then felt nauseous and  vomited up just the sprite. He has not felt fevers or chills at  home. Last normal bowel movement was the day prior. He continues  to pass some flatus.  Upon evaluation in the ED, he did undergo  a CT scan, which was originally read as negative. He was PO  challenged, and then sent home. However, he was called back in  in the afternnon because the CT final read showed some indication of inflammation/fat  stranding around the mid-appendix.  On evaluation in the ED by  surgery, he appears comfortable although still does endorse some abdominal pain, mainly  epigastric. He states that the pain severity is somewhat waxing  and waning. He does not currently have any other symptoms and is  hungry.     Past Medical History: Past Medical History: none  Past Surgical History: R lateral neck soft tissue mass excision   Social History: ___ Family History: no history of GI disease or cancers, no significant heart  disease to his knowledge


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of abdominal pain, initial negative CT scan, subsequent finding of inflammation/fat stranding around the mid-appendix, and persistent epigastric pain, it's crucial to gather more information to determine if appendicitis is present and the severity of the inflammation.  A physical exam focusing on abdominal tenderness and signs of peritonitis is necessary.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal tenderness to palpation (especially in McBurney's point, RLQ, and epigastric region), rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign, Murphy's sign, bowel sounds

ToolMessage:
"Admission   V/S: T97.6, HR81, BP105/71, RR16, Sat99%RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, moderately distended, tender to palpation especialy  in epigastrium and RLQ without rebound with voluntary guarding. -Rovsing's sign, +psoas/obturator signs Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with initial mid-abdominal pain radiating upwards and downwards, followed by nausea and vomiting, raises suspicion for appendicitis. The initial negative CT scan followed by a finding of inflammation/fat stranding around the mid-appendix further supports this possibility.  The physical exam findings of tenderness in the epigastrium and RLQ, along with positive psoas and obturator signs, suggest localized peritoneal irritation. While the patient appears comfortable and hungry, the waxing and waning nature of the pain, combined with the physical exam findings, warrants further investigation to definitively rule out appendicitis and assess the need for surgical intervention.
