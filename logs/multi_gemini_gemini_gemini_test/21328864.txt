HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/ history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with 2 week history of abdominal pain that is chronic in nature. Over the last few days it has worsened but it has not prevented him from  performing any of his activities.   ROS: (+) per HPI (-) Denies fevers chills, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue/malaise/lethargy, changes in appetite, trouble  with sleep, pruritis, jaundice, rashes, bleeding, easy bruising, headache, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, weakness, paresthesias, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, bloating, cramping, melena,  BRBPR, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, edema,  urinary frequency, urgency   Past Medical History: PMH: erosive gastritis in the early ___ which required blood transfusions, epididymitis, hypertension,left shoulder and has had plantar fasciitis in the past.

Grandfather had stomach cancer, died at the age of ___. His  mother and father are alive and well.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and abdominal pain, it's crucial to rule out recurrence or complications related to the lymphoma. The chronic nature of the pain with recent worsening raises concern.  While the review of systems is mostly negative, the lack of fever, chills, night sweats, and weight loss doesn't definitively exclude lymphoma-related issues.  Information about the location, quality, and radiation of the pain is missing.  Additionally, details about the prior lymphoma treatment and current disease status are needed.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam (including palpation, percussion, auscultation),  lymph node exam (cervical, supraclavicular, axillary, inguinal), assessment for ascites, vital signs

ToolMessage:
"Physical Exam at Admission:   Vitals:98.6, 100, 131/85, 16, 97% RA GEN: A&Ox3, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender to palpation in the RLQ without rebound Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused  Physical Exam"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The physical exam reveals tenderness in the right lower quadrant without rebound tenderness. This localization helps narrow down the potential causes. While lymphoma recurrence is still possible, other causes of right lower quadrant pain, such as appendicitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or even a hernia, need to be considered.  The patient's history of intussusception surgery as a child raises the possibility of adhesions.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is warranted to further evaluate the cause of the pain.  Lab tests are also needed to assess for infection and other abnormalities.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, LDH, ESR, CRP

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The elevated white blood cell count with a high neutrophil percentage suggests an inflammatory process, possibly infectious.  However, the normal CRP, ESR, and LDH (if obtained later and within normal limits) would argue against a significant infection or lymphoma recurrence.  The normal CMP values are reassuring. The abdominal tenderness localized to the RLQ, combined with the elevated WBC and neutrophils, raises suspicion for appendicitis.  A CT scan is crucial to visualize the appendix and surrounding structures.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast matches the available CTU (ABD/PEL) W/CONTRAST study. Here is the complete report:  CTU (ABD/PEL) W/CONTRAST (CTU):  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen pelvis with without contrast.  TECHNIQUE: CTU: Multidetector CT of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired prior to and after intravenous contrast administration with the patient in prone position. The non-contrast scan was done with low radiation dose technique. The contrast scan was performed with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 1) Spiral Acquisition 4.9 s, 53.9 cm; CTDIvol = 15.5 mGy (Body) DLP = 836.1 mGy-cm. 2) Stationary Acquisition 3.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 14.4 mGy (Body) DLP = 7.2 mGy-cm. 3) Spiral Acquisition 4.9 s, 53.9 cm; CTDIvol = 15.6 mGy (Body) DLP = 838.6 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 1,682 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: There is a 5 mm peripheral nodule in the left lower lobe (4:6), unchanged from prior. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout, with diffuse hypodensity, compatible with hepatic steatosis. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is surgically absent.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no nephrolithiasis or ureterolithiasis. There is no hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. A subcentimeter hypodensity in the lower pole of the left kidney too small to characterize on CT. There is no evidence of urothelial lesions. The distal ureters and bladder are unremarkable.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. There is a dilated appendix, measuring up to 13 mm, with significant fat stranding at the tip. A punctate calcification in the area of fat stranding may represent an appendicolith which is now extraluminal. The remaining colon and rectum are within normal limits.  PELVIS: There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Prostate contains coarse calcifications. Seminal vesicles are unremarkable. Note is made of a high-riding right testicle, similar to prior.  LYMPH NODES: Multiple enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are seen, some which are increased in size most recent prior, for example, lateral caval lymph node measures 2.8 x 3.0 cm (04:51), previously 3.6 x 2.2 cm. Others are decreased in size, for example, a left upper quadrant lymph node now measures 1.6 x 2.4 cm (04:40), previously 1.8 x 3.1 cm, and a right lower quadrant lymph node now measures 0.7 x 1.3 cm (04:54), previously 1.1 x 1.5 cm. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Mild to moderate multilevel degenerative changes of the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spine.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan reveals a dilated appendix with significant fat stranding at the tip, suggestive of acute appendicitis. The extraluminal appendicolith further supports this diagnosis.  While the CT also notes enlarged mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, some of which have increased in size compared to prior imaging, the overall picture, combined with the physical exam and lab results, points towards appendicitis as the primary cause of the patient's abdominal pain. The patient's history of lymphoma requires careful consideration of the lymphadenopathy, but the acute nature of the current abdominal pain and the CT findings make appendicitis the most likely diagnosis.

Preoperative antibiotics should be administered to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.
