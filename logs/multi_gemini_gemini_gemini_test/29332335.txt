HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___, at 11pm last night felt a dull ___ pain, but was  able to sleep through most of the night. Overnight she had 1  normal non-bloody stool. The next day she felt nauseated, had  fevers to 100, and at 4pm her pain migrated to the RLQ. She had  1 episode of non-bilious, non-bloody emesis at 8pm. Her last  meal was at 4pm.   She has not been sexually active for over a year, and has had no  vaginal discharge. She has no history of IBD, has never had  bloody stools or frequent diarrhea. No family history of IBD.      Past Medical History: fibroadenoma, ? irritable bowel syndrome  PSH: fibroadenoma resection    Social History: ___ Family History: Noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms of RLQ pain, fever, nausea, and emesis suggest appendicitis.  Migrating pain from periumbilical to RLQ is a classic sign.  However, to make an informed decision, I need to gather more information through physical examination, and lab tests.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign,  rebound tenderness, abdominal guarding,  vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pressure)

ToolMessage:
"Upon presentation to ___:  100.0 94 115/94 16 100%  AAOx3 NAD RRR CTAB soft RLQ tender below McBurney's point rectal - guaiac negative, no masses Pelvic - no adnexal tenderness or fullness, no CMT no edema, extrem warm"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting. The migration of pain from the periumbilical region to the RLQ, along with McBurney's point tenderness, strongly suggests appendicitis.  The negative psoas, obturator, and rectal exam findings do not rule out appendicitis.  Given the concerning presentation, I would order a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of her symptoms.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the complete report:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast. No oral contrast administered.  FINDINGS: No consolidation or pleural effusion at the lung bases. The liver enhances homogeneously. There is no extra- or intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. The gallbladder is normal. The spleen is unremarkable. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of hydronephrosis or pyelonephritis. There is a 5 mm pancreatic hypodensity likely cyst with tiny septation (2:27). There are no pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum or mesentery. There is no free fluid or free air. There is no bowel obstruction.  CT PELVIS: Unfortunately, no oral contrast was administrated, and patient is thin, which gives a suboptimal evaluation. There is a tubular structure in the right lower abdominal quadrant, measuring 1.4 cm, with enhancing wall, which could suggest ____ in appropriate clinical setting. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis. No pathologically enlarged lymph nodes in the pelvic or inguinal area. There is suggestion of septate uterus. Urinary bladder is unremarkable. Small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain migrating from the periumbilical region, fever, nausea, vomiting, and positive McBurney's point tenderness strongly suggests appendicitis. The CT scan findings of a tubular structure in the right lower quadrant with an enhancing wall further support this diagnosis. While the lack of oral contrast limits the evaluation, the clinical picture combined with the imaging findings is highly suggestive of appendicitis.  The small amount of free fluid in the pelvis is also concerning and could be related to the inflammatory process.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain migrating from the periumbilical region, fever, nausea, vomiting, and McBurney's point tenderness strongly suggests appendicitis. The CT scan findings of a tubular structure in the right lower quadrant with an enhancing wall further support this diagnosis. The small amount of free fluid in the pelvis is also consistent with appendicitis. While the CT report mentions the possibility of a septate uterus, this is less likely to be the cause of the acute symptoms.  The 5mm pancreatic hypodensity is likely an incidental finding.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian cyst
3. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)
4. Ectopic pregnancy
5. Mesenteric adenitis

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for appendectomy. Administer IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte balance.  Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover common enteric bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem). Provide pain management with analgesics (e.g., morphine, hydromorphone). Monitor vital signs and clinical status closely.  Post-operative care should include wound care, pain management, and monitoring for complications such as infection or abscess formation.
