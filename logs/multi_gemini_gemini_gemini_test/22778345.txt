{"final":"Thought: The patient presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and chills.  She has a history of recent heavy alcohol use and a prior CT scan showing a dilated common bile duct.  Her labs are significant for a markedly elevated lipase, elevated AST and ALT, and leukocytosis, which, in conjunction with her presentation, strongly suggests acute pancreatitis.

HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with a history of depression,  PTSD, GSW to chest, presents for evaluation of acute abdominal  pain.   Patient presented 2 weeks ago to the ED with similar, but less  severe pain in the RUQ and epigastrum.  CT ab at that time  showed dilated CBD, but patient left before an US could be  preformed. For the past three days she has experienced sharp  epigastric pain that comes and goes.  Pain came on again  suddenly last night at approx midnight, is continuous and has  worsened.  Pain is severe at ___, sharp, stabbing, band-like  distribution over upper abd, extending to her back.  The pain is  diffuse and was associated with multiple episodes of NBNB emesis  with +nausea.  Worsened by movement.  No diarrhea, last stool  approx 2 days ago, which is her norm.  No fevers, + chills, +  sweats.   Of note, patient reports heavy drinking (~10 beers) on weekend.  History of heavier EtOH in the past. She's never had gallstones  in the past. No new medications. No recent travel.     Past Medical History: PMH: depression, anxiety, gastritis  PSH: GSW to L chest leading to sternotomy, ex-lap    Social History: ___ Family History: Mostly unknown. ___ had diabetes.

Thought: Given the patient's history of RUQ pain, dilated CBD on a recent CT, recent heavy alcohol consumption, and current symptoms of severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and chills, the most likely diagnoses include acute pancreatitis, cholecystitis, or cholangitis.  I need to gather more information to differentiate between these possibilities and rule out other causes of abdominal pain.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, nausea, vomiting, and significantly elevated lipase points strongly towards acute pancreatitis. The elevated AST and ALT, while suggestive of liver involvement, can also be seen in severe pancreatitis.  The patient's history of recent heavy alcohol use further supports this diagnosis.  The prior CT scan showing a dilated CBD raises the possibility of gallstone pancreatitis, but given the severity of the pancreatitis and the patient's unstable presentation, an abdominal ultrasound to assess for gallstones should be performed after the patient is stabilized.
