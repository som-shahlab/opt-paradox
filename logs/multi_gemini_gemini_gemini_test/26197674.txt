Ms. ___ is a ___ woman who was in her usual state of health until 2pm yesterday ___, when she developed diffuse, sharp, abdominal pain which eventually localized to the RLQ today. She has had poor appetite since the pain began, but  no nausea or vomiting. She was able to tolerate some soup this morning. She reports feeling chills, no fever. Her last bowel movement was this morning, with non-bloody and regular stools. She denies any dysuria or pelvic pain. ROS per HPI.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating to the RLQ, concerning for appendicitis.  Given the chills and anorexia, infection is high on the differential. I need to assess for peritoneal signs and systemic signs of infection. A CBC will help evaluate for leukocytosis suggestive of infection.  Urinalysis can help rule out UTI, which can sometimes present with RLQ pain.
Action: laboratory tests

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation is highly suspicious for appendicitis.  She has RLQ pain, anorexia, and chills. While she does not report fever, her elevated WBC and neutrophils suggest an infectious process.  The normal urinalysis makes a UTI less likely. To confirm the diagnosis, I need imaging.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 4.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 19.3 mGy (Body) DLP = 9.6 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 6.4 s, 50.6 cm; CTDIvol = 14.0 mGy (Body) DLP = 707.1 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 717 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: A 2-3 mm nodule is seen in the right lung base (02:10). There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN:  HEPATOBILIARY: A couple subcentimeter hypodensities are seen in the right hepatic lobe, too small to fully characterize but likely representing hepatic cyst or biliary hamartomas. The liver otherwise demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout. There is abnormal dilatation of the main pancreatic duct, measuring up to 5 mm (02:33). There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: A small subcentimeter hypodensity seen in the spleen, too small to characterize, possibly a small hemangioma. Otherwise, the spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. Multiple cortically based hypodense lesions are seen in bilateral kidneys, most of which are too small to fully characterize, with the largest measuring up to 1.3 cm, compatible with simple cysts. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The appendix appears enlarged, measuring up to 2.0 cm (102:98), with adjacent fat stranding, concerning for ____. A tiny pocket of rim enhancing fluid is seen adjacent to the tip of the appendix measuring 6 x 8 mm (series 102, image 98). There is extensive surrounding fat stranding with small areas of non circumscribed fluid. The stomach is unremarkable. There is mild surrounding fat stranding and thickened appearance of the distal terminal ileum, likely reactive. Otherwise, the remaining small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. There is reactive mild thickening of the cecum. The colon appears diffusely mildly thick walled with areas of submucosal fat deposition suggesting sequela of chronic colitis. This predominantly involves the transverse, descending and sigmoid colon.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus is unremarkable. There is no adnexal abnormality.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. A sclerotic focus in the superior endplate of L5 vertebral body likely represents bone island.  SOFT TISSUES: Note is made of a tiny fat containing umbilical hernia. Otherwise, the abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, anorexia, chills, and leukocytosis suggested appendicitis. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, showing an enlarged appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding and a small fluid collection.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, anorexia, chills, and leukocytosis suggested appendicitis. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, showing an enlarged appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding and a small fluid collection.  The findings of cecal thickening and terminal ileitis are likely reactive changes related to the appendicitis. The incidental findings on the CT scan do not appear to be acutely concerning.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Cecal Diverticulitis
3. Mesenteric Adenitis
4. Ovarian Cyst
5. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy. Given the presence of a fluid collection, this should be done expeditiously to prevent complications such as perforation or abscess formation.  I recommend a laparoscopic appendectomy, which is associated with less postoperative pain, faster recovery, and lower risk of wound infections compared to open appendectomy.  The patient should be started on IV antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, such as a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) and metronidazole.  The patient should also receive IV fluids for hydration and pain management. Postoperatively, the patient should be monitored for complications such as infection, bleeding, or ileus.  She should be encouraged to ambulate early and advance her diet as tolerated.  The patient should be discharged home once she is tolerating a regular diet, her pain is controlled with oral medications, and she has had a bowel movement.  She should follow up with her surgeon in 1-2 weeks for wound check and further evaluation.
