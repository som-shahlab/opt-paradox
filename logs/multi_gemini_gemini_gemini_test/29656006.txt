HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This is a ___ 6 wks postpartum with a history of biliary colic, now presenting with RUQ pain.  The pain started at 1am, woke her from sleep.  Is sharp, ___ in the RUQ.  No radiation.   She went to ___ where ___ US showed stones in the GB as well as an 8.8mm CBD.  Bili was 1.3, and LFTs and AP were elevated.  Normal WBC of 6.3.  Patient was transferred to ___ for ERCP.  Surgery was consulted for recommendations.    Past Medical History: PMH: none  PSH: c-sxn x 3    Social History: ___ Family History: non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: This patient is 6 weeks postpartum, presenting with RUQ pain, and imaging reveals gallstones and a dilated common bile duct.  Elevated bilirubin and LFTs suggest biliary obstruction.  Given her prior biliary colic, the current presentation is highly suspicious for choledocholithiasis.  I need to understand the character of the pain, any associated symptoms, and if there are any risk factors for complications.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Murphy's sign, assessment for jaundice, vital signs including temperature

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: This patient is 6 weeks postpartum with RUQ pain, gallstones, a dilated CBD, elevated bilirubin and LFTs, and tenderness in the RUQ.  The ultrasound showing stones in the gallbladder and a dilated CBD, combined with the abnormal liver function tests and bilirubin, strongly suggests choledocholithiasis. The physical exam findings of RUQ and midepigastric tenderness further support this.  Given the patient's presentation and the available information, I have enough information to recommend a course of action.

* **NPO:** Maintain the patient NPO until after ERCP.
* **Post-ERCP Care:** Monitor for pancreatitis, bleeding, or perforation.
* **Surgical Consultation:** Continue close collaboration with the surgical team for definitive management of cholelithiasis with laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
