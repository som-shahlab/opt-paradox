HTN   Borderline DM Asthma   Fibroid uterus Osteoarthritis    Social History: ___ Family History: Extensive DM, CAD on father's side. BRCA on father's side.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's recent ERCP, the acute onset of abdominal pain raises concern for post-ERCP complications such as pancreatitis, perforation, or bleeding.  The elevated liver enzymes and lipase further support this possibility. I need to gather more information to assess these potential complications.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute epigastric pain radiating to the lower abdomen following an ERCP, combined with significantly elevated lipase (2463 IU/L), strongly suggests post-ERCP pancreatitis. The elevated ALT, AST, and total bilirubin are also consistent with this diagnosis, possibly reflecting pre-existing liver abnormalities exacerbated by the procedure.  The absence of amylase and coagulation studies makes it difficult to fully assess the severity of pancreatitis and potential bleeding risk. However, given the strong clinical suspicion, I would proceed with treatment for post-ERCP pancreatitis.

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought:This patient presents with acute abdominal pain following an ERCP with a significantly elevated lipase, highly suggestive of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP).  Her elevated ALT, AST, and total bilirubin are consistent with her underlying liver disease and may be exacerbated by the PEP.

Other post-ERCP complications like perforation or bleeding are less likely given the absence of peritoneal signs, hemodynamic instability, or significant anemia.  Her history of transaminitis and other medical conditions are important to consider in her overall management but are not the primary focus at this time.
