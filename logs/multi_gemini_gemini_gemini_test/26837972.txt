HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ years old male with history of gluten intolerance presented  with fevers and abdominal pain since yesterday. Patient  developed fevers yesterday per patient as high as "107", patient  also reports 2 episodes of emesis yesterday - non bloody, crampy  diffuse abdominal pain, which improved overnight. Patient denies dysuria, sick contacts, had BM yesterday - non diarrhea. Patient  reports chills since yesterday, with intermittent headaches, no  SOB, no chest pain.  Of note patient has history of gluten intolerance and underwent  colonoscopy with upper endoscopy year ago at ___&W with biopsy,  with findings WNL, no celiac disease.    Past Medical History: PMH: gluten intolerance - diagnosed ___ year ago                                         PSH: sinus Sx/septoplasty  ___ ___&W   Social History: ___ Family History: father - newly dg. glioblastoma


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with fever, abdominal pain, emesis, chills, and headache.  Given the history of gluten intolerance, it's important to rule out complications related to gluten ingestion, such as celiac crisis, although previous endoscopy/colonoscopy with biopsy did not confirm celiac disease.  The high fever (107°F) raises concern for infection.  Other potential causes of abdominal pain with fever and emesis include gastroenteritis, appendicitis, or other inflammatory processes.  I need more information to narrow down the possibilities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show elevated neutrophils and low lymphocytes, suggesting a possible bacterial infection.  The normal lipase, CMP, and urinalysis make pancreatitis and kidney infection less likely.  While the patient has a history of gluten intolerance, the lack of diarrhea and normal lab values do not point towards celiac crisis.  The reported fever of 107°F is extremely high and needs to be verified.  I need to perform a physical exam to assess the patient's current condition and vital signs, including confirming the fever.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation), abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, palpation, percussion),  HEENT (head, ears, eyes, nose, throat) exam

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with fever, abdominal pain, and emesis.  Initial labs showed elevated neutrophils and low lymphocytes, suggesting a possible bacterial infection.  The physical exam revealed right lower quadrant tenderness, a temperature of 99.8°F, and otherwise normal vital signs.  The initial fever of "107°F" was likely inaccurate.  The combination of RLQ tenderness, fever, and elevated neutrophils points towards appendicitis.  While other diagnoses are possible, appendicitis is the most likely explanation given the available information.

DiagnosisMessage:

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Mesenteric adenitis
4. Early Diverticulitis
5. Celiac Crisis (less likely given previous negative biopsy)

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for possible appendectomy.  Continue IV fluids.  Administer analgesics for pain control (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone).  Administer antiemetics for nausea and vomiting (e.g., ondansetron).  Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics with anaerobic coverage (e.g., piperacillin/tazobactam or ampicillin/sulbactam).
