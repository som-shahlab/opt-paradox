Denies anorexia.     Past Medical History: Hypertension Morbid obesity Saddle pulmonary embolus   Social History: ___ Family History: His mother had breast cancer in her ___ and had genetic testing  that was negative.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right-sided abdominal pain, emesis, and chills concerning for several possible diagnoses including appendicitis, cholecystitis, or complications related to the prior pulmonary embolism (PE) such as bowel ischemia or even a new PE. Given the patient's history of PE and current anticoagulation therapy, it's crucial to assess for signs of active bleeding or new thromboembolic events. Additionally, the patient's constipation followed by diarrhea after taking milk of magnesia needs further evaluation to rule out other gastrointestinal issues.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has right-sided abdominal pain, emesis, chills, and a history of PE on Coumadin. Lab results show low hemoglobin/hematocrit, low potassium, elevated INR/aPTT, and low albumin.  The elevated INR suggests Coumadin is at therapeutic levels, but the combination of abdominal pain and anemia raises concern for bleeding, possibly retroperitoneal or within the GI tract. The low potassium may be due to vomiting/diarrhea or poor intake. While the lipase is normal, I'd like to obtain imaging to evaluate for appendicitis, cholecystitis, or other causes of abdominal pain, especially given the concerning lab results.  A D-dimer would also be helpful to assess for recurrent PE, though the patient's current anticoagulation makes interpretation challenging.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Among the available studies, there are two CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast examinations. I'll provide the most recent one:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast.  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total exam DLP: 1399.99 mGy-cm  FINDINGS: Somewhat limited study due to body habitus.  LOWER CHEST: There is subsegmental atelectasis in the lower lobes. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: In the right lower quadrant, there is a periappendiceal abscess with adjacent fatty stranding which measures 6.7 x 5.6 cm (series 2:71), significantly increased in size from CT abdomen pelvis ___, previously measuring 3.4 x 3.2 cm. There is no free intraperitoneal gas. The small and large bowel loops are otherwise unremarkable without evidence of obstruction. The stomach is unremarkable.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate is not enlarged.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with right-sided abdominal pain, emesis, and chills.  Laboratory tests revealed anemia, hypokalemia, and a supratherapeutic INR.  CT imaging confirms a periappendiceal abscess.  Given the patient's anticoagulation status (supratherapeutic INR), the abscess is likely the source of the patient's current symptoms and the anemia.  The hypokalemia is likely secondary to vomiting and diarrhea.  The patient requires treatment for the abscess.

Coumadin should be held, and Vitamin K should be administered to reverse the anticoagulation.  Surgical consultation is recommended to evaluate the need for percutaneous drainage or appendectomy.
