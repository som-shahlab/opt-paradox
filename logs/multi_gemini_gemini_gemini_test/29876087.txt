HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
HPI: ___ w/ anxiety who presents with <16h of RLQ pain that started this morning at 3AM.  Pain woke the patient from sleep; she had nausea followed by small emesis.  Pain did not subside.  Presented to ED with CT scan demonstrating remarkable  appendiceal inflammation. Peritonits on exam.    Past Medical History: PMHx: anxiety, ADDD    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's presentation with RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and CT findings of appendiceal inflammation and peritonitis, appendicitis is the likely diagnosis. However, it's crucial to assess the severity of the peritonitis and rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain, such as ovarian torsion or ectopic pregnancy in females.  Additionally, understanding the patient's baseline anxiety and ADHD is important for pain management and communication.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, CT scan findings, and laboratory results support the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia is consistent with an inflammatory process. The negative beta-hCG and normal lipase help rule out ectopic pregnancy and pancreatitis, respectively.  Other lab values are within normal limits.  Given the peritonitis on exam, surgical intervention is indicated.
