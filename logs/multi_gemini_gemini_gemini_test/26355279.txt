She in fact developed abdominal pain 10 days  ago, on good ___, and presented to ___.  She was discharged  from the ED.  She was called back for possible pulmonary edema,  and to rule out MI, which was negative.  After discharge, she continued to have abdominal pain, with  nausea and anorexia.

Thought: The patient presents with a 10-day history of constant abdominal pain radiating to the back, associated with nausea, anorexia, shortness of breath, dark urine, and chills.  The pain started after a period of protein shake consumption for weight loss.  Given the history of possible CKD, prior cholecystectomy, and recent protein shake use, I need to investigate several potential diagnoses including pancreatitis, renal colic, and other gastrointestinal or genitourinary issues.  I'll start with laboratory tests to assess organ function and look for evidence of inflammation or infection.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show significantly elevated lipase, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin.  The elevated lipase strongly suggests pancreatitis. The elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin could be due to gallstone pancreatitis or other biliary obstruction.  The eGFR is low, suggesting some degree of kidney dysfunction.  I have enough information to make a differential diagnosis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Pancreatitis (likely gallstone pancreatitis)
2. Acute Cholecystitis
3. Chronic Kidney Disease exacerbation
4. Peptic Ulcer Disease
5. Mesenteric Ischemia

Treatment:
* Hospitalization for supportive care.
* NPO (nothing by mouth) initially, then gradual advancement to a low-fat diet as tolerated.
* IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte management.
* Pain management with IV opioids (e.g., morphine, hydromorphone).
* Antiemetics for nausea and vomiting (e.g., ondansetron, promethazine).
* Close monitoring of vital signs, including oxygen saturation.
* Repeat laboratory tests (lipase, amylase, CMP, CBC) to track disease progression.
* Abdominal imaging (CT scan with contrast) to assess the pancreas and biliary tree for gallstones or other complications.
* Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) if gallstones are identified and causing biliary obstruction.
* Cholecystectomy may be necessary if gallstones are the cause of pancreatitis.
* Consultation with a gastroenterologist and nephrologist for further management of pancreatitis and CKD.
