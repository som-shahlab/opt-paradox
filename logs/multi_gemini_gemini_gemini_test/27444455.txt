HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This is a pleasant ___ yo lady with a PMH significant for symptomatic cholelithiasis who presents with a 4 day history of epigastric and RUQ pain accompained by nausea and NBNB emesis. Denies fevers, chills, diarrhea, changes in stool or urine  color.  She went to ___ last night where labs were drawn and showed:  WBC: 17.9 H/H: 14.2/43.0 Plt: 316 Chem 7: Na: 139, K: 3.8, Cl: 100 HCo3: 25.7 BUN: 21, Cr 1.0 gluc;184. ALT: 647 AST: 1045 AP: 148 Tbili: 0.8 Alb: 3.5 TProt 6.5 Lip: 1356 Ca 9.1 She was then transferred to ___ for further evaluation and management. Here in the ED she appears comfortable. Her pain has gotten significantly better after receiving pain medications.  She also developed an urticarial rash in the past 24 hrs. She denies taking any new medications or eating anythin unusual.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: symptomatic cholelithiasis, cervical cancer in situ   Past Surgical History: conization of cervix    Social History: ___ Family History: Non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and significantly elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, Alk Phos), concerning for biliary pathology, likely acute cholecystitis given her history of symptomatic cholelithiasis. The elevated WBC count further supports an infectious/inflammatory process.  The new-onset urticarial rash is interesting and needs further investigation to rule out any allergic reactions or other dermatological conditions, but it does not immediately change my primary suspicion of acute cholecystitis.  I need imaging to confirm this suspicion.
Action: imaging
Action Input: RUQ ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"Here is the RUQ ultrasound report (listed as \"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)\"):  TECHNIQUE: Right upper quadrant ultrasound.  FINDINGS: The liver is normal in echotexture without focal or textural abnormalities. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The common bile duct is not dilated measuring 3 mm. The gallbladder is not distended with wall edema and numerous gallstones. Sonographic ___ sign is unreliable given pain medication. The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The pancreas is normal in appearance, though the distal tail is not well seen. The right kidney measures 9.8 cm. The left kidney measures 11.3 cm. There are parapelvic cysts bilaterally without hydronephrosis, stone, or mass. The spleen is not enlarged measuring 9.4 cm. There is no free fluid."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RUQ pain, nausea, vomiting, significantly elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, Alk Phos), and elevated WBC count, along with the history of symptomatic cholelithiasis, strongly suggests acute cholecystitis. The RUQ ultrasound confirms the presence of gallstones and gallbladder wall edema, further supporting this diagnosis.  The absence of sonographic Murphy's sign is likely due to pain medication, as noted in the report.  The urticarial rash may be unrelated, possibly an allergic reaction, but requires further evaluation.  I have enough information to recommend a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Cholecystitis
2. Choledocholithiasis
3. Drug-induced Liver Injury
4. Viral Hepatitis
5. Gallstone Pancreatitis

Treatment: Admit the patient for supportive care, including IV fluids, pain control, and antiemetics.  Consult surgery for laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics covering gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Piperacillin-Tazobactam or Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole). Monitor liver function tests and complete blood count. Investigate the urticarial rash and consider antihistamines if indicated.  NPO initially, then advance diet as tolerated post-operatively.  Provide patient education regarding cholecystectomy and post-operative care.
