InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain, vomiting, chills, and subjective fevers.  Labs show elevated transaminases and lipase, concerning for biliary pathology. Ultrasound showed gallstones without acute cholecystitis. Given the persistent symptoms despite initial management in the ED, I need to gather more information to assess the current status and rule out other potential causes.
Action: laboratory tests

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show elevated ALT, AST, total bilirubin, and INR.  The lipase is now normal, but was previously elevated in the ED.  The elevated transaminases, bilirubin, and INR suggest hepatocellular injury and impaired liver function. The previously elevated lipase raises suspicion for gallstone pancreatitis, which may have resolved.  The patient continues to have RUQ pain and nausea.  I will request an abdominal CT scan to evaluate the biliary tree and surrounding organs for any signs of complications, such as choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast is not available in the provided list of imaging studies. The only available imaging study is an abdominal ultrasound."

The elevated transaminases, bilirubin, and INR suggest hepatocellular injury and impaired liver function. The previously elevated lipase raises suspicion for gallstone pancreatitis, which may have resolved. The patient continues to have RUQ pain and nausea.  Since a CT A/P with contrast isn't available, I will review the existing ultrasound findings and proceed with a clinical diagnosis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Choledocholithiasis
2. Resolving Gallstone Pancreatitis
3. Acute Cholangitis
4. Biliary Dyskinesia
5. Acute Cholecystitis

Treatment:
* Continue intravenous fluids (e.g., Normal Saline) to maintain hydration.
* Administer antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) for nausea and vomiting.
* Provide pain control with analgesics (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone).
* Proceed with the scheduled ERCP to visualize the biliary tree and remove any obstructing stones.  If stones are found, sphincterotomy and stone extraction should be performed.
* Monitor liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase) and coagulation studies (INR, PTT).
* If cholangitis is suspected (fever, jaundice, RUQ pain), initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., piperacillin-tazobactam or imipenem).
* After ERCP, if the patient's symptoms resolve and liver function tests normalize, plan for laparoscopic cholecystectomy to prevent recurrent biliary events.
* Consult with gastroenterology and surgery for ongoing management.
