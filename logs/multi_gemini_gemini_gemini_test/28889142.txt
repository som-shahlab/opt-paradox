HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ yo F with acute onset of RUQ pain after  eating nachos. She notes sharp, severe epigastric pain that then radiated to RUQ and associated nausea and vomiting. Abd U/S at OSH showed evidence of gallstones. No vomiting, fevers. No history of this in the past.   Denies F/C/CP/SOB/HA/jaudice/icterus/BRBPR/melena/diarrhea/ hematuria/dysuria    Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute RUQ pain after eating a fatty meal, a classic presentation for biliary colic or cholecystitis.  The ultrasound showing gallstones supports this. To differentiate between biliary colic and cholecystitis, I need to assess for signs of inflammation and infection.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC, CMP, lipase, amylase

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation is highly suggestive of cholecystitis given the acute RUQ pain, nausea/vomiting, and positive ultrasound for gallstones. The laboratory results show a mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia, which could indicate inflammation, but the liver enzymes, bilirubin, lipase, and amylase are all within normal limits.  While amylase is missing, the normal lipase makes pancreatitis less likely.  The absence of fever and the normal labs suggest this may be a case of biliary colic, but given the leukocytosis, cholecystitis cannot be ruled out.  A HIDA scan would help determine if the cystic duct is obstructed and confirm the diagnosis of cholecystitis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: HIDA scan with ejection fraction

ToolMessage:
"The requested HIDA scan with ejection fraction is not available among the provided imaging studies. The available studies are only an abdominal ultrasound and a chest x-ray."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including acute RUQ pain, nausea/vomiting, and a positive ultrasound for gallstones, points towards cholecystitis.  The mild leukocytosis and neutrophilia suggest inflammation. Although a HIDA scan would be ideal for confirming cholecystitis, it's not available.  Given the clinical picture and lab results,  I will proceed with a presumptive diagnosis of cholecystitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Biliary Colic
2. Cholecystitis
3. Gastritis
4. Pancreatitis
5. Hepatitis

Treatment:  The patient should be treated conservatively initially.  This includes pain management with NSAIDs or opioids if needed, antiemetics for nausea and vomiting, and a low-fat diet.  The patient should be advised to avoid fatty foods and to follow up with a gastroenterologist for evaluation for possible cholecystectomy.  If the pain does not resolve or if signs of infection develop (fever, increasing leukocytosis, worsening pain), then further evaluation and possible hospital admission for IV fluids, antibiotics, and surgical consultation should be considered.
