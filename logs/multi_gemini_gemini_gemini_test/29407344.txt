HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ h/o PSC diagnosed ___ years ago, followed by Dr. ___ in ___ showed no evidence of UC, now with an acute episode of epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting since the afternoon of presentation. She reports that she had breakfast without an issue and starting around noon had severe epigastric pain, nausea and ___ episodes of vomiting. She has had similar episodes in the past but they have all lasted only a few hours. This was unremitting until she came to the ED at which point her symptoms began to self-resolve. She is now hungry and drank some ginger-ale in the ED without any increase in symptoms. She describes her pain as gnawing, no radiation to the back.  Of note, her PSC history is as follows: she was diagnosed with PSC based on features of an MRI in the setting of an elevated  Alk Phos. She had a liver biopsy performed in ___, which was  limited but showed no evidence of fibrosis. She had a colonoscopy done  in ___ which showed no evidence of UC. She had a recent MRCP on ___ which showed a cirrhotic liver with confluent fibrosis  in the setting of PSC and a hepatic angioma vs. adenoma, pancreas has always looked nml on all imaging. She has had multiple ___, previous one in ___ was 11.  She denies any fevers, chills, shortness of breath, constipation (last BM was the day of presentation, passing flatus), chest pain, dysuria.   ROS: (+) per HPI (-) Denies pain, fevers chills, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue/malaise/lethargy, changes in appetite, trouble  with sleep, pruritis, jaundice, rashes, bleeding, easy bruising, headache, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, weakness, paresthesias, hematemesis, bloating, cramping, melena, BRBPR, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, edema,  urinary frequency, urgency    Past Medical History: PSC diagnosed ___ years ago, HTN, eczema  PSH: hand surgeries, no abdominal surgeries    Social History: ___ Family History: One child, healthy. Father medical history unknown. Mother:  COPD. Cousin - ?liver disease

Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting that has self-resolved. Given her history of PSC with cirrhosis, it's crucial to rule out serious complications like cholangitis, hepatic decompensation, and bowel obstruction.  Her history of intermittent similar episodes raises suspicion for biliary colic or a functional disorder, but thorough evaluation is necessary.  Missing information includes the frequency of vomiting, details about prior similar episodes (duration, triggers, associated symptoms), and specific timing of events (year of PSC diagnosis, liver biopsy, colonoscopy, MRCP, ERCPs).  Knowing the trend of her Alk Phos and total bilirubin would also be helpful.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation and now significantly elevated lipase are highly suggestive of acute pancreatitis.  While her Alk Phos is also elevated, which is expected with her PSC, the degree of elevation in lipase points towards pancreatitis as the primary cause of her current symptoms.  Her elevated WBC count further supports an inflammatory process. The other lab values are largely unremarkable, though mild transaminitis is present. I will now conclude the information gathering.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with acute epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting, followed by self-resolution, initially suggested biliary colic or a functional disorder. However, the significantly elevated lipase (3270 IU/L) points towards acute pancreatitis as the primary diagnosis.  Her history of PSC and cirrhosis, along with elevated Alk Phos and transaminases, are important considerations, but the acute nature of her symptoms and the markedly high lipase make pancreatitis the most likely cause. The elevated WBCs and glucose further support this diagnosis. While her symptoms have resolved, the degree of lipase elevation warrants further management for pancreatitis. The low potassium likely reflects vomiting and dehydration.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Pancreatitis
2. Biliary Colic
3. Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis (PSC) exacerbation
4. Functional dyspepsia
5. Bowel obstruction

Treatment: Admit for acute pancreatitis management.  Initiate IV fluids for rehydration, addressing the low potassium.  Pain control with IV analgesics as needed.  NPO initially, then advance to a low-fat diet as tolerated.  Monitor lipase trends, CMP, and CBC.  Abdominal imaging (CT abdomen with contrast) should be considered to assess for pancreatic necrosis or other complications.  Evaluate for potential causes of pancreatitis, including gallstones (abdominal ultrasound), alcohol use, and medications.  Given her PSC history, an MRCP may be warranted in the future to assess for biliary strictures if the pancreatitis is thought to be related to PSC.  Consult gastroenterology for further management of PSC and pancreatitis.  Close monitoring and supportive care are crucial.
