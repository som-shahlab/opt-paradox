HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w/no PMH p/w RLQ pain since 6pm yesterday.  Never had similar pain.  +subjective fevers, but did not take temperature.   +Nausea, no vomiting.  No change in bowel habits.  No hematochezia/melena.  No urinary symptoms.   Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: none


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, subjective fevers, and nausea.  These symptoms could indicate appendicitis, but other diagnoses such as ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy (if female), or kidney stones are also possible.  A physical exam is necessary to evaluate for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam to assess for tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate

ToolMessage:
"Vitals:98.4 60 113/80 16 99RA Gen: NAD CV: RRR Abd: S, TTP RLQ, +Rovsing's sign Ext: no c/c/e"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, subjective fevers, nausea, and no change in bowel habits.  The physical exam reveals tenderness in the RLQ, a positive Rovsing's sign, and normal vital signs.  The positive Rovsing's sign increases the suspicion for appendicitis.  While the patient's temperature is normal, it is possible they had a fever earlier.  Given the concerning findings, imaging is warranted to evaluate for appendicitis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial multidetector CT images through the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous and oral contrast. Multiplanar reformations.  Total DLP: 348 mGy-cm  FINDINGS: Partially imaged lung bases are notable for mild dependent atelectasis. There is no pleural effusion.  CT abdomen: The liver enhances homogeneously without concerning lesions or biliary dilatation.  Gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are within normal limits.  There kidneys enhance and excrete symmetrically without concerning lesions or hydronephrosis.  A 4 mm right renal hypodensity is too small to characterize.  Stomach is distended with oral contrast.  Fluid distended loops of small bowel are normal in course and caliber. There is no obstruction.  Colon is unremarkable.  The appendix is fluid-filled and dilated to 9 mm with adjacent fat stranding, consistent with ____. There is no extraluminal gas or large fluid collection to suggest perforation.  There is no intra-abdominal free air or fluid.  There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  Abdominal aorta is of normal caliber throughout.  CT pelvis: Bladder is collapsed around a Foley catheter. Uterus is grossly unremarkable. A corpus luteal cyst is incidentally noted in the right ovary. Small amount of pelvic free fluid is present.  Bone window: No concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous lesion identified. Mild sacroiliac degenerative joint disease is present."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with RLQ pain, subjective fevers, and nausea.  Physical exam revealed RLQ tenderness and a positive Rovsing's sign.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, demonstrating a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding.  There is no evidence of perforation.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, subjective fevers, nausea, and a positive Rovsing's sign on exam. The CT scan confirms appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding.  There is no evidence of perforation.  The small amount of pelvic free fluid is likely related to the ovarian cyst.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian cyst
3. Kidney stone
4. Ectopic pregnancy (if female, though less likely given lack of vaginal bleeding or severe pain)
5. Mesenteric adenitis

Treatment:  Appendectomy is indicated given the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on surgeon preference and patient factors.  Pre-operative antibiotics should be administered to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem).
