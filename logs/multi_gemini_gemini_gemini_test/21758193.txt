Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ male with PMH of hypertension and cognitive  delay presents who presents with 2 weeks of vomiting and  epigastric/RUQ abdominal pain. Patient's mother, who is  patient's guardian and primary historian, reports noticing  abdominal pain and vomiting clear or yellow liquid 1-2/d for  2wks. The vomiting initially improved but then began to worsen,  so his mother brought him to the ED. Patient's mother is unsure  if he has had any diarrhea, but reports that he has had BMx1 per  day. He was seen by his PCP ___ ___ who prescribed  chlorpromazine for hiccups and scheduled CT scan for next week.  Pt's mother has noticed chills and sweats associated with  episodes of vomiting.    Mr. ___ has lost 20lbs in 2 weeks, which she attributes to  poor appetite and n/v.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with concerning symptoms including weight loss, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Given the patient's history and current symptoms, several diagnoses are possible, including gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, or gastrointestinal obstruction. Further investigation is needed to narrow down the differential diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The lab results are largely unremarkable, except for slightly elevated glucose.  The normal lipase and amylase make pancreatitis less likely.  Given the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, weight loss, and family history of gallstones, I still suspect gallbladder pathology. An abdominal ultrasound would be helpful to visualize the gallbladder. I will also request a urinalysis as it was previously unavailable.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN):  TECHNIQUE: Grey scale and color Doppler ultrasound images of the abdomen were obtained.  FINDINGS:    LIVER: The hepatic parenchyma appears within normal limits. The contour of the liver is smooth. There is no focal liver mass. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. There is no ascites.  BILE DUCTS: There is mild intrahepatic biliary ductal prominence. There is no extrahepatic biliary dilation. The CHD measures 4 mm.  GALLBLADDER: The gallbladder is filled with numerous shadowing gallstones, with edematous wall thickening up to approximately 1 cm.  PANCREAS: The imaged portion of the pancreas appears within normal limits, without masses or pancreatic ductal dilation, with portions of the pancreatic tail obscured by overlying bowel gas.  RETROPERITONEUM: The visualized portions of aorta and IVC are within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a two-week history of vomiting, epigastric/RUQ abdominal pain, weight loss, chills, and sweats.  His mother reports noticing abdominal pain and vomiting clear or yellow liquid 1-2 times per day for two weeks. The vomiting initially improved but then worsened. He has had daily bowel movements. His PCP prescribed chlorpromazine for hiccups and scheduled a CT scan for the following week. He has a family history of gallstone disease. Initial laboratory tests revealed normal CBC, CMP (except for slightly elevated glucose), lipase, and amylase.  The abdominal ultrasound shows numerous shadowing gallstones within the gallbladder and edematous wall thickening up to approximately 1 cm.  These findings, combined with the patient's symptoms and family history, strongly suggest a diagnosis of cholecystitis.
