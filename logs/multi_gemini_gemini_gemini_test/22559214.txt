HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a otherwise healthy ___ year-old woman who presents with seven days of abdominal pain.   Seven days ago, her abdominal pain first started. It began as a diffuse pain around the umbilicus that reminded her of pain she would associate with constipation. The pain was constant and did not radiate.  Three days ago, she began to have RLQ pain on self-palpation.  Yesterday, she went to her PCP for evaluation. She was found to have a WBC elevated to 11.5 without a fever. An abdominal X-ray was not diagnostic.  Yesterday night, she experienced chills and noted a temperature of 99.5F. Her discomfort motivated her to present to the ___ ED.  She denies nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or SOB. She has had decreased appetite for 1 day. Her last bowel movement was  earlier this afternoon.    Past Medical History: PMH: None  PSH: None   Social History: ___ Family History: Maternal Uncle died of stomach cancer in his early ___.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's presentation of initially periumbilical pain migrating to RLQ pain, elevated WBC count, and chills, appendicitis is high on the differential. However, other diagnoses such as constipation, ovarian cysts, or pelvic inflammatory disease are possible.  I need more information to narrow down the diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign), pelvic exam

ToolMessage:
"Admission  VS T 99.1F, BP 113/91, P 95, RR 18, O2SAT 100 RA Patient is comfortable, pleasant, and in no acute distress. Normal peripheral perfusion Non-labored respirations Abdomen is soft, non-distended, and mildly tender in the RLQ. No guarding."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, low-grade fever, and elevated WBC count, along with mild tenderness in the RLQ on physical exam, further increases the suspicion for appendicitis.  A CT scan would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT and pelvis with contrast  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 656 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The appendix is hyperemic and distended measuring up to 1.5 cm (601:35) containing 2 large appendicoliths with significant adjacent inflammation extending to the base of the cecum and proximal ascending colon with adjacent small volume free fluid and questionable locules of air (2:61). Findings are compatible with acute ____ concerning for perforation. No associated abscess formation is identified. Multiple prominent mesenteric lymph nodes are visualized in the right lower quadrant. The remaining colon and rectum are within normal limits.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder wall is thickened unclear if this is a separate etiology or secondary to peritoneal inflammation from ____. There is small volume free fluid in the pelvis. REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable. LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted. BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___ ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 2:46 am, 10 minutes after discovery of the findings."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis with concern for perforation. The patient requires an appendectomy.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of migrating RLQ pain, fever, elevated WBC, and the CT findings of a hyperemic and distended appendix with appendicoliths and surrounding inflammation strongly suggest acute appendicitis with possible perforation. The other considered diagnoses are less likely given the CT findings.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis with possible perforation
2. Appendicitis
3. Ovarian Cyst
4. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
5. Constipation

Treatment:  The patient requires emergent surgical consultation for appendectomy. Given the concern for perforation, broad-spectrum antibiotics with anaerobic coverage (e.g., Piperacillin/Tazobactam or Cefoxitin plus Metronidazole) should be initiated immediately.  Fluid resuscitation with IV crystalloids (e.g., Normal Saline or Lactated Ringer's) should be started to address potential dehydration and sepsis.  Pain management with IV opioids (e.g., Morphine or Hydromorphone) should be provided.  Post-operatively, the patient should receive continued antibiotic therapy, pain management, and wound care.  The patient should be monitored for complications such as abscess formation or peritonitis.
