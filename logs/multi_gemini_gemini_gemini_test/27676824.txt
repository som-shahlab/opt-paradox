HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ years old female who presents with about 24 hours of abdominal pain. Initially started in the  midepigastric and umbilical area  as a dull, aching sensation. Gradually worsening with time and now localizing to the right lower quadrant as sharp abdominal pain. No radiation.  Exacerbated by bumps in the car ride. She also reports some associated chills, nausea, with one episode of non bilious vomiting. She denies diarrhea, no dysuria or other urinary symptoms.     Past Medical History: hypothyroid    Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation suggests appendicitis.  Given the location, onset, and progression of the pain, along with associated symptoms like chills, nausea, and vomiting, it's crucial to rule out appendicitis and other potential causes of right lower quadrant pain. I need to gather more information through physical examination to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on palpation of right lower quadrant, McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign,  rebound tenderness, guarding;  assess for fever.

ToolMessage:
"On admission:  Vitals: 100.1 107 143/77 18 100%   GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender to palpation in the RLQ, + rebound tenderness, no guarding, no palpable masses Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including the migration of pain from periumbilical to the right lower quadrant, worsening pain, fever, nausea, vomiting, and positive rebound tenderness strongly suggests appendicitis.  The physical exam findings further support this diagnosis. While other diagnoses are possible, I have enough information to recommend surgical consultation for suspected appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Ovarian Torsion
4. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
5. Right Lower Quadrant Pain (nonspecific)

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for possible appendectomy.  Administer IV fluids for hydration.  Provide pain relief with analgesics (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone) as needed.  Administer prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of metronidazole and ceftriaxone) to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.
