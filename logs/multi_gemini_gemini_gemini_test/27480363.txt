HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
The patient is a ___ year old female who presented to ED with R  sided abdominal pain since ___. She reported that her pain  started at periumbilical region and migrated to RLQ. She denied  any fever, chills, nausea, vomiting. She did have slight  anorexia. She denied any recent sick contact.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: - Chronic neck pain - Supraventricular tachycardia  Past Surgical History: - None    Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, which is a classic symptom of appendicitis. However, the lack of fever, nausea, and vomiting makes the diagnosis less clear.  I need more information to assess the patient's condition and rule out other possible diagnoses like ovarian cysts, kidney stones, or pelvic inflammatory disease.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, McBurney's point palpation, Obturator sign, Psoas sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate

ToolMessage:
"On admission:  Vitals: 97.8 110 136/61 16 99%  GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender on palp at RLQ, no rebound, +voluntary guarding Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, tenderness on palpation at RLQ, and voluntary guarding.  While she lacks fever, nausea, and vomiting, the localized tenderness and guarding raise suspicion for appendicitis.  Given the patient's age and sex, ovarian cysts or pelvic inflammatory disease are also possible. A CT scan is necessary to visualize the appendix and rule out other pathologies.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained from the base of the lungs to the pubic symphysis after administration of 130 cc of Omnipaque nonionic intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were prepared.  FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Visualized lung bases demonstrate mild bibasilar atelectasis. The visualized heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. The appendix (2:59, 601b:32) is dilated to 10 mm with mild surrounding inflammatory changes with surrounding fat stranding, particularly at the tip. These findings are consistent with early ____. No drainable fluid collection or extraluminal gas is seen. There is no evidence of free air or free fluid in the abdomen. Two subcentimeter hypodensities are visualized in the liver (2:13, 20), and are too small to characterize. Otherwise, the liver is within normal limits. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, visualized loops of small and large bowel, bilateral adrenal glands, and bilateral kidneys are normal. The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber and contour. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy by CT size criteria.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The bladder, uterus, ovaries, and rectum are within normal limits. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid or free air in the pelvis.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no lytic or sclerotic lesions suspicious for malignancy."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, tenderness, and voluntary guarding, combined with the CT findings of a dilated appendix with surrounding inflammatory changes and fat stranding, strongly suggests acute appendicitis.  The absence of fever, nausea, and vomiting does not rule out appendicitis, as these symptoms can present later in the course of the illness. The CT findings confirm the diagnosis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain migrating from periumbilical region, along with tenderness at RLQ and voluntary guarding, initially suggested appendicitis. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, revealing a dilated appendix with surrounding inflammatory changes and fat stranding, consistent with early appendicitis.  The absence of fever, nausea, and vomiting is not unusual in early appendicitis. Other diagnoses, such as ovarian cysts or pelvic inflammatory disease, have been ruled out by the CT scan.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Cyst
3. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
4. Kidney Stone
5. Constipation

Treatment:  Given the CT findings consistent with early appendicitis,  a laparoscopic appendectomy is recommended. This minimally invasive procedure is the standard of care for acute appendicitis and offers faster recovery, less pain, and lower risk of complications compared to open appendectomy.  The patient should be started on IV fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole) preoperatively. Postoperatively, pain management should be provided, and the patient should be monitored for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  A follow-up appointment should be scheduled to monitor healing and remove sutures/staples if necessary.
