HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with Hx HTN, HLD, atrial fibrillation on Eliquis, T2DM not on insulin, and prior CVA, presents as OSH transfer w/ confusion (now resolved), fever, and c/f cholangitis  Per pt, in normal state of health until early morning of ___, awoke with confusion, mod-severe, brief and improved by the time of hospital arrival. Denies any associated subj fever (though febrile in ED), n/v, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation. No recent cold-like Sx, SOB, cough. No change in PO intake, though pt notes he has been eating more vegetables and eating less overall, intentionally, as he was advised by PCP to lose some weight. Has been in normal state of health. Called EMS and went initially to ___ but confusion had resolved by that time and only complaint was his chronic neck pain  Per pt, about ___ years ago was told he had gallstones and had an ERCP with stent placed at ___. Was initially going to get CCY but then was advised to hold off and never had one. No recurrence of biliary colic Sx since then. Has not continued to f/u with GI.   OSH ED records reviewed and summarized as follows:  On arrival febrile to 101.2, AST/ALT both in 300s. BR 5.3, wbc  20 RUQUS showing no stones but reportedly suggestive of cholangitis Gave CTX (at 1400 on ___ and Flagyl (1500) Transfer to ___ for ERCP  In ED: VS: afeb, HR 70, 128/64, 98% on RA ED Exam: AOx2, nonseptic appearing, CV irregularly irregular, no RUQ TTP Labs: wbc 21, hb 12.9, INR 2.2, alt 333, ast 244, AP 305, lipase 790, Tbili 5.3, BMP unremarkable, Cr 1.0 UCX, BCx sent Imaging: CXR read as low lung volumes but no acute process Received: IVF and apixaban 5 (abx at OSH not redosed yet)    Past Medical History: HTN, HLD, atrial fibrillation on Eliquis, T2DM not on insulin, and prior CVA   Social History: ___ Family History: nc


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with signs and symptoms concerning for cholangitis, likely secondary to a previously placed biliary stent.  Given the history of ERCP with stent placement and current laboratory findings (elevated AST/ALT, AP, Tbili, and WBC), it's crucial to visualize the biliary tree to assess for obstruction, stones, or other abnormalities.  Additionally, the patient's elevated lipase raises concern for concomitant pancreatitis, although it's less likely the primary issue given the other findings. Further imaging is needed to evaluate the pancreas.  The patient's coagulopathy (INR 2.2) needs to be addressed before any invasive procedures.
Action: imaging
Action Input: MRCP, RUQ Ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"From the requested imaging studies (MRCP and RUQ Ultrasound), I can provide the MRCP report as it's available in the list:  MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC): EXAMINATION: MRCP TECHNIQUE: T1- and T2-weighted multiplanar images of the abdomen were acquired in a 1.5 T magnet. Intravenous contrast: 7 mL Gadavist. Oral contrast: 1 cc of Gadavist mixed with 50 cc of water was administered for oral contrast. FINDINGS: Lower Thorax: There is no pleural effusion. Liver: The liver is normal in morphology. There is no focal lesion. There is no hepatic steatosis. Biliary: There is choledocholithiasis and 2 stones noted at the level of ampulla largest measuring 10 mm (series 4, image 9) causing extrahepatic and intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation with the CBD measuring 12 mm. There is minimal enhancement of intrahepatic biliary duct suggestive of mild cholangitis. There is no intrahepatic abscess. The gall bladder is distended with no definite gallstones noted. Pancreas: The pancreas is atrophic with no focal lesion noted. There is minimal dilatation of the pancreatic duct measuring up to 4 mm. Spleen: The spleen is within upper limit of normal size measuring 12.9 cm with no lesion noted. Adrenal Glands: The adrenal glands are normal. Kidneys: Punctate cyst is seen in upper pole of the left kidney. Otherwise the kidneys are normal with no evidence of hydronephrosis. Gastrointestinal Tract: The bowel is normal in caliber with no evidence of obstruction. There is sigmoid diverticulosis. Lymph Nodes: There is no lymphadenopathy. Vasculature: The portal veins and hepatic veins are patent. There is no aneurysm. Osseous and Soft Tissue Structures: Degenerative changes are seen in the spine most pronounced at the lumbar spine. There is depression deformity of endplate of L4.  The RUQ Ultrasound is not available in the list of available imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The MRCP confirms choledocholithiasis with obstruction at the ampulla, causing biliary ductal dilatation and mild cholangitis. The pancreas appears atrophic with minimal ductal dilatation, making significant pancreatitis less likely.  The patient's elevated lipase may be secondary to the biliary obstruction or another process. Given the confirmed choledocholithiasis and cholangitis, the patient requires ERCP for stone removal and biliary drainage.  The patient's coagulopathy (INR 2.2) needs to be reversed prior to the procedure.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Cholangitis secondary to Choledocholithiasis
2. Gallstone Pancreatitis
3. Drug-induced Coagulopathy (Eliquis)
4. Atrial Fibrillation
5. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus

Treatment:
1. Hold Eliquis and reverse coagulopathy with Vitamin K and/or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) as indicated by the patient's INR and clinical status.  Consult hematology if needed.
2. Broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Piperacillin-Tazobactam, or Ceftriaxone plus Metronidazole).
3. Fluid resuscitation with intravenous crystalloids.

5. Consider cholecystectomy during the same admission or shortly thereafter to prevent recurrent cholangitis.
6. Monitor vital signs, laboratory values (including liver function tests, lipase, and INR), and clinical status for improvement.
7. Resume Eliquis once clinically stable and INR is therapeutic, after discussion with cardiology regarding stroke risk stratification.
8. Educate the patient on the importance of follow-up with gastroenterology and cardiology.
