HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ F with a history of Crohn's disease  tx w/  Remicade since ___ for perianal disease, was admitted to the medical service  on ___ with RLQ pain, ileal thickening on CT scan, and presumed Crohn's flare. She was in her usual state of health until 11 AM on ___ when she experienced sudden, severe RLQ pain that radiated to her back while she was out shopping. The pain improved slightly overnight, but this afternoon it returned to ___. Denies, fever, chill, N/V. Reports very minimal flatus  and no BM since yesterday at 11 AM. Was started on Zosyn and Cipro.    Past Medical History: 1. Crohn's disease s/p ileocecal resection 2. Surgical drainage of rectal fistula.   3. Anemia thought to be secondary to iron deficiency.   4. Known cholelithiasis.   5. Reflux   6. ___      Social History: ___ Family History: No coronary artery disease, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease with perianal involvement, presenting with RLQ pain radiating to the back, decreased flatus and bowel movements, and ileal thickening on CT. This suggests a possible Crohn's flare or complication like an abscess or stricture. However, the sudden onset of severe pain also raises concern for other acute abdominal processes such as appendicitis, even though it is less likely given her Crohn's history.  I need to gather more information to differentiate between these possibilities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show a mild leukocytosis with neutrophilia, but normal CRP, ESR, and lactic acid.  The urinalysis is concerning for large blood, which is not explained by her symptoms or history.  While the initial CT showed ileal thickening, the sudden onset of pain and hematuria warrant further imaging to evaluate for other potential causes.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"There are two CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT) reports available. The second one appears to be the most complete CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report, which I'll provide here:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT): CT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS PERFORMED ON ___.: Comparison is made with a prior study from ___.   TECHNIQUE: MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis following the administration of 130 ml Optiray IV contrast. No oral contrast was administered for this exam. Coronal and sagittal reformations were provided.  FINDINGS:   LUNG BASES: There is new subsegmental atelectasis at both lung bases. No pleural or pericardial effusion is seen.  ABDOMEN: There is free intraperitoneal air noted along the anterior edge of the liver which is new from prior study. Air is also seen tracking along the periportal region as well as posterior to the liver. Patient is status post cholecystectomy. There is a stable-appearing small hypodensity in hepatic segment VIII seen on series 2, image 17. Mild intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is stable and likely related to prior cholecystectomy. The pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands appear normal. Kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly. Abdominal aorta and major branch vessels are widely patent. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The stomach and duodenum appear normal.  PELVIS: Residual dense barium is noted within the large bowel, which is the residual from the contrast administered during yesterday's CT exam. There are abnormally thickened small bowel loops in the right hemipelvis with surrounding fat stranding, significantly worse compared with yesterday's exam. Extraluminal gas is noted at this level which is concerning for perforation at this level. There is loss of fat plane between these inflamed loops of bowel and the urinary bladder with thickening along the bladder wall. This appearance is concerning for impending development of enterovesical fistula. Adjacent loops of large bowel appear thickened, likely reactive. No dilated loops of small bowel are seen. There is no drainable fluid collection. The right ovary cannot be separated from the inflamed bowel in the right hemipelvis. The left ovary appears grossly unremarkable. Patient is status post hysterectomy.  BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or blastic osseous lesion is seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan reveals free intraperitoneal air and extraluminal gas in the right hemipelvis, indicating a bowel perforation.  The thickened small bowel loops with surrounding fat stranding, worse than the prior CT, along with the loss of fat plane between the bowel and bladder, suggest a severe inflammatory process and possible fistula formation.  The patient's clinical picture, including sudden severe RLQ pain, now correlates with the imaging findings of a perforated bowel, requiring urgent surgical intervention.
