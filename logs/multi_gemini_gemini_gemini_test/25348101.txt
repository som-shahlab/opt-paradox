HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ w hx HTN, anxiety p/w abdominal pain x 2 days. In usual  state of health until day prior to presentation when she  developed epigastric abdominal discomfort. Over the next ___  pain migrated to RLQ. Described as ___ severity, constant,  non-radiating. Worse w movement. No alleviating factors. No  prior episodes of similar pain. Endorses associated chills, anorexia,  nausea and non-bloody emesis. Came to ED for evaluation. Surgery  consult obtained.   On surgery eval, patient relays hx as above. Minimal po intake  since onset of pain. No po intake for greater than 6 hours.  +Flatus/BM. Denies fever, chest pain, shortness of breath,  constipation, diarrhea, blood per rectum, dysuria.   Past Medical History: PMH: HTN, anxiety/depression, insomnia  PSH: Inguinal hernia repair, exploratory laparoscopy for fertility workup   Social History: ___ Family History: No fam hx GI malignancy of IBD


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ abdominal pain, chills, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, which could indicate appendicitis. However, given her history of HTN, anxiety/depression, and previous abdominal surgeries (inguinal hernia repair, exploratory laparoscopy), other diagnoses like ovarian cysts, bowel obstruction, or even a hernia recurrence need to be considered.  I need to gather more information through physical examination and lab tests to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, and rigidity), pelvic exam, Murphy's sign, McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign

ToolMessage:
"P/E: VS:  98.9 75  119/72  16  100% RA   GEN: WD, WN in NAD HEENT: NCAT, anicteric CV: RRR PULM: non-labored, no respiratory distress ABD: soft, +tender to palpation in RLQ, negative Rovsings, ND,  no mass PELVIS: deferred EXT: WWP, no CCE NEURO: A&Ox3, no focal neurologic deficits"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, tenderness to palpation in the RLQ, chills, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, along with the physical exam findings, increases the suspicion for appendicitis.  However, other differentials like ovarian cysts, bowel obstruction, or even a hernia recurrence are still possible. Laboratory tests are needed to further evaluate the patient's condition and help differentiate between these possibilities.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, urinalysis, pregnancy test (if applicable), CRP, lactate

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings (RLQ tenderness), and laboratory results (leukocytosis with neutrophilia) are highly suggestive of appendicitis.  While CRP and lactate would be helpful to further assess the inflammatory process, the available information points strongly towards appendicitis.  The mild hypokalemia is likely due to vomiting.  I will request a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis to confirm the diagnosis before proceeding to surgical consultation.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis.  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. IV Contrast: 130 mL Omnipaque. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. Oral contrast was administered.  DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 6.0 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 28.9 mGy (Body) DLP = 14.4 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 4.9 s, 53.0 cm; CTDIvol = 12.7 mGy (Body) DLP = 670.1 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 684 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. A 1.1 cm left hepatic hypodensity (2:9) likely represents a cyst or hepatic hemangioma. Several smaller, subcentimeter hepatic hypodensities are too small to characterize but also likely cysts. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is fluid-filled and dilated up to 1.3 cm, containing numerous intraluminal appendicoliths and surrounding inflammatory change. Trace fluid is noted along the right pericolic gutter. However, there is no evidence of perforation or associated abscess formation.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. A small umbilical hernia containing fat is noted."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam, laboratory findings (leukocytosis with neutrophilia), and CT scan findings (dilated appendix with appendicoliths and surrounding inflammatory changes) confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The patient requires an appendectomy.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam, laboratory findings (leukocytosis with neutrophilia), and CT scan findings (dilated appendix with appendicoliths and surrounding inflammatory changes) confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The CT scan also identified a small umbilical hernia and a possible hepatic cyst or hemangioma, which are incidental findings and not related to the current presentation.  The patient requires an appendectomy.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Cyst (ruled out by CT)
3. Bowel Obstruction (ruled out by CT)
4. Hernia Recurrence (ruled out by CT)
5. Constipation (ruled out by history and exam)

Treatment:  The patient should be made NPO and given IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte correction (specifically addressing the hypokalemia).  Administer IV antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin, or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole).  Consult general surgery for laparoscopic appendectomy.  Post-operatively, the patient should receive pain management, continue IV antibiotics until afebrile and tolerating a regular diet, and be monitored for complications such as surgical site infection or intra-abdominal abscess.  Discharge instructions should include wound care, pain management, activity restrictions, and follow-up with the surgeon.
