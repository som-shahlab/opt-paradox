Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ M with PMH s/f cocaine abuse, ETOH-ism,  and   tobacco use who presents with acute on chronic abdominal pains.    He describes his abdominal pain as being worse with eating and  his pain is worse around epigastric region with radiatiion  towards back and lower left chest at times. He reports 1 week of  "black-ish" and dark stools and a few drops of BRB in toilet 2  days ago after BM. last BM was this morning. No recent diarrhea,  no hematemesis or overt melena. Minimal intermittent nausea but  no emesis. He explains that he has been seen at ___ multiple  times in past for similar abdominal pains over last year but  only given Maalox with limited workup. Never had an EGD or  colonscopy. In terms of his polysubstance abuse issues, he  states he stopped using alcohol 3 months ago but last used crack  cocaine yesturday (using 2x week).   .   Initial vitals in ED were: T 98.9F, BP 132/45, HR 109, RR 16 and  O2 sats 100% RA. On rectal exam he was guaiac positive with Hct  of 25.5 (unknown baseline) and elvated lipase 161. GI fellow was  consulted from ED and advised admission with IV PPI, CT abdomen  and IVFs with plan for a.m. GI consult ___ as well. Prelim  read of abdominal CT showed pancreatitic duct  dilitation/stranding and multiple liver lesions. In ED he was  given IV pantoprazole 40mg, 2L NS IVFs, 4mg IV morphine, IVFs  and kept NPO.   .   Vitals on transfer to floor were: ___, BP 132/88, HR 92, RR 18,  sat 98% RA. On arrival to medical floor he appeared to be in no  apparent distress but complaining of poor appetite and limited  PO over last 2 days which has left him feeling "empty".   .      Past Medical History: -ETOH abuse (states last drink 3 months ago)   -chronic abdominal pains   -crack cocaine use /last used yesturday (using 2x week)   -s/p CCY   -s/p appendectomy   -told his liver was "enlarged" in past   -smoking tobacco   .      Social History: ___ Family History: Mother died of lung CA, no GI cancers in family and no other GI  diseases per patient.

Thought: The patient presents with acute on chronic abdominal pain, concerning for several potential diagnoses including pancreatitis, GI bleed, and liver lesions. Given his history of polysubstance abuse, chronic abdominal pain, and new concerning findings (dark stools, BRBPR, low Hct, elevated lipase, and liver lesions on CT), a thorough workup is needed. The current information lacks details about the character of the abdominal pain, the patient's prior workup for abdominal pain, and the characteristics of the liver lesions.

Thought: The patient's lab results show anemia, thrombocytosis, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and elevated lipase. The anemia could be chronic or related to a GI bleed. The elevated lipase suggests pancreatitis, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and CT findings. The elevated alkaline phosphatase could be due to liver or bone pathology. The thrombocytosis could be reactive.  The patient's history of cocaine use and alcohol abuse, along with the current presentation, raises concern for a GI bleed, pancreatitis, and liver disease.  A fecal occult blood test, hepatitis panel, and HIV test were ordered but not resulted yet.  I will wait for these results and then proceed with further actions.
