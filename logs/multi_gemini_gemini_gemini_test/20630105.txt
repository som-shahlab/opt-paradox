HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ previously healthy presents with abdominal pain x 1 day. She had sharp pain that was alleviated with bending over and worse with lying down. She reports nausea and 1 episode of vomiting. She denies vaginal bleeding, BRBPR, melena, hematemesis, cough, weight loss. Her last meal and BM were yesterday.  She denies chills, fever, weight loss, BRBPR, melena, dysuria, shortness of breath, heart palpitation, chest pain.   Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: Non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain with concerning features like sharp pain relieved by bending over and worsened by lying down, along with nausea and vomiting. This presentation could indicate a number of intra-abdominal pathologies such as pancreatitis, appendicitis, cholecystitis, or even a perforated viscus.  I need more information to narrow down the differential diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show leukocytosis with neutrophilia, which suggests an inflammatory process.  The normal lipase makes pancreatitis less likely. Given the patient's presentation with acute abdominal pain worse with lying down and better with bending over, along with nausea and vomiting, appendicitis is still high on the differential.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast would help visualize the appendix and rule out other causes of abdominal pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT)  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Single phase contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 908 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: LOWER CHEST: Visualized lungs are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The dome of the liver is excluded from view. The visualized liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The dome of the spleen is excluded from view, but otherwise the spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Thickening about the cecum at the takeoff of the appendix may be reactive. Otherwise, the colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is dilated up to 1.0 cm (02:48), fluid-filled, and hyperenhancing with subtle periappendiceal stranding consistent with ____. No local fluid collection or appendicolith.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: There is a small fat containing umbilical hernia."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and the CT findings of a dilated, fluid-filled, and hyperenhancing appendix with periappendiceal stranding strongly suggest appendicitis.  The other abdominal organs appear normal on the CT scan.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  The pain was sharp, relieved by bending over, and worsened by lying down, which is suggestive of appendicitis.  The initial labs showed leukocytosis with neutrophilia, indicating an inflammatory process.  The normal lipase made pancreatitis less likely. The CT scan confirmed the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated, fluid-filled, and hyperenhancing appendix with periappendiceal stranding.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Cecitis
3. Mesenteric adenitis
4. Ovarian torsion (if female)
5. Early bowel obstruction

Treatment: The patient should be started on IV fluids, pain medication, and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin, or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole).  A surgical consult should be obtained for an appendectomy.  Laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred surgical approach.  The patient should be monitored for complications such as perforation, abscess formation, and peritonitis.
