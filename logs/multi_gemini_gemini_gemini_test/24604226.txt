Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with past medical history significant  for prior abdominal surgeries, most recently status-post right  hemicolectomy ___ for stage IIa colon ca, who complains of a  1 day of abdominal pain/nausea, transferred from ___ for  concern for small bowel obstruction. Patient reports she awoke  from sleep around 3am on the morning of admission with severe  sharp cramping diffuse abdominal pain accompanied by nausea, no  vomiting. Had a soft formed bowel movement two hours later with  some relief, but pain later worsened and nausea persisted. She went to ___ for  further evaluation, where she was found to have an elevated WBC  count to 17 and a KUB with dilated loops of small bowel with air  fluid levels suggestive of a small bowel obstruction. An NG tube  was placed (amount that initially came out was not documented)  which provided some relief for her nausea, and she was  transferred to ___ for further management. Patient  reports she has not passed any flatus since yesterday. Denies  fever/chills, dysuria, changes in bowel habits, blood in stools,  or recent weight loss. Reports she has never had pain like this  before. She had a surveillance colonoscopy in ___, which  showed evidence of recurrent disease or anastomotic stricture.  Last CT Torso was ___ which was also clean and showed no  evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease.    ROS: (+) per HPI    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: hepatic flexure colon cancer, gastric  ulcer, iron deficiency anemia ___ cancer and ulcer (2uPRBC  ___, HL, HTN, heart murmur, hypothyroidism, prediabetes  stable with weight loss, lichen sclerosis, agoraphobia w/panic  attacks   Past Surgical History: D&C, hysterectomy, umbilical hernia  repair      Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory

Thought: Given the patient's history of abdominal surgeries, acute onset of abdominal pain, nausea, elevated WBC, and KUB findings suggestive of small bowel obstruction, it's crucial to determine the cause and severity of the obstruction.  While the KUB suggests SBO, a CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast would provide more detailed information about the location, cause, and degree of obstruction, and help rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain. Additionally, a detailed physical exam is necessary to assess the current status of the abdomen.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the CT Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast report from the available studies. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after the uneventful administration of 130 cc Omnipaque intravenous contrast and oral contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats were generated. Total exam DLP: 607 mGy-cm. CTDI: 32 mGy.  FINDINGS: There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN: The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesions. There is mild intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation, which appears stable since prior examination. The gallbladder is distended and contains multiple calcified gallstones. There is mild amount of surrounding pericholecystic fluid and fat stranding. The CBD is prominent measuring up to 11 mm (601 b: 34). These findings could represent Mirizzi's syndrome however, this is uncertain given preexisiting prominence of CBD as seen on prior examination. No stones are seen within the CBD. The adjacent loops of bowel appear somewhat thickened, likely due to a reactive inflammatory response. The portal vein is patent. The pancreas does not demonstrate focal lesions, peripancreatic stranding or fluid collections. There is no pancreatic duct dilatation. The spleen is homogeneous and normal in size. There is redemonstration of a 2.0 x 1.8 cm nodule in the left adrenal gland. The adrenal glands are otherwise unremarkable. There are multiple bilateral hypodensities in the kidneys which are too small to further characterize on this examination. The kidneys otherwise enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast without evidence of hydronephrosis or mass. An orogastric tube terminates within the gastric fundus. The patient is status post hemicolectomy. The stomach, duodenum, small bowel and colon are grossly unremarkable. There is no evidence of small bowel obstruction. There are no dilated loops of bowel. Surgical anastomosis appears grossly intact. The appendix is not visualized but there is no evidence of appendicitis. The intra-abdominal aorta demonstrates mild atherosclerotic calcifications. The aorta is of normal diameter. The celiac axis, SMA, bilateral renal arteries and ___ are patent. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria. No intraabdominal free fluid or free air noted.  CT OF THE PELVIS: The urinary bladder and terminal ureters are normal. No pelvic or inguinal lymph node enlargement is seen. There is a small amount of pelvic free fluid measuring up to 24 Hounsfield units, likely secondary to the acute inflammatory changes (2:73).  OSSESOUS STRUCTURES: No blastic or lytic lesion suspicious for malignancy is present."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan ruled out small bowel obstruction and did not reveal any other obvious cause for the patient's acute abdominal pain. The report notes mild pericholecystic fluid and fat stranding, a prominent common bile duct, and some thickening of adjacent bowel loops, raising suspicion for Mirizzi syndrome or cholecystitis.  Given the patient's pain, nausea, elevated WBC, and these findings, further evaluation of the gallbladder and biliary tree is warranted.  A physical exam, specifically focusing on abdominal tenderness and signs of gallbladder inflammation, is necessary.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam, focusing on tenderness to palpation (especially in the right upper quadrant), Murphy's sign, and assessment for peritoneal signs.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with acute abdominal pain, nausea, elevated WBC, and initial KUB findings suggestive of SBO raised concern for a surgical abdomen. However, the CT scan ruled out SBO and revealed findings suggestive of cholecystitis/Mirizzi syndrome (pericholecystic fluid, fat stranding, prominent CBD, thickened adjacent bowel). The physical exam revealed tenderness around the incision sites but no other significant findings.  While the lack of pronounced tenderness or Murphy's sign argues against acute cholecystitis, the CT findings and elevated WBC still warrant further investigation.  Given the patient's complex surgical history and the possibility of Mirizzi syndrome, surgical consultation is recommended.
