HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old female presents with  abdominal pain for 14 hours.   Patient noted crampymid/epigastric abdominal pain last night  which has progressed to RLQ pain.  Associated with nausea and chills.  Denies emesis,  diarrhea, fevers, recent weight changes.  Denies prior symptoms.      Past Medical History: GERD, MS, h/o pyelonephritis    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's presentation of abdominal pain migrating from the mid/epigastric region to the RLQ, accompanied by nausea and chills, appendicitis is a primary differential diagnosis. Other possibilities include mesenteric adenitis, ovarian torsion, or a gynecological issue.  I need more information to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign), pelvic exam

ToolMessage:
"___: VS: 98.6 69 117/71 16 99% RA  Gen: NAD, AOx3 ___: reg Pulm: no distress Abd: S/ND/TTP RLQ - Rovsing's ___: no LLE"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's vital signs are stable, but the physical exam reveals tenderness in the RLQ, and a positive Rovsing's sign, which further increases the suspicion for appendicitis.  A pelvic exam was not performed, which could help rule out gynecological causes.  Additionally, laboratory tests and imaging can help confirm the diagnosis.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, urinalysis, pregnancy test

ToolMessage:
"I'll help you organize the results for the requested tests:  CBC with differential: - White Blood Cells: 12.5 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 4.24 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 13.2 g/dL - Hematocrit: 39.8% - MCV: 94.0 fL - MCH: 31.1 pg - MCHC: 33.1% - RDW: 12.6% - Platelet Count: 201.0 K/uL - Differential:   - Neutrophils: 78.3%   - Lymphocytes: 17.2%   - Monocytes: 2.8%   - Eosinophils: 1.6%   - Basophils: 0.1%  CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel): - Sodium: 142.0 mEq/L - Potassium: 4.3 mEq/L - Chloride: 104.0 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 29.0 mEq/L - Urea Nitrogen: 5.0 mg/dL - Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL - Bilirubin, Total: 0.3 mg/dL - Alkaline Phosphatase: 86.0 IU/L - AST: 17.0 IU/L - ALT: 15.0 IU/L  Urinalysis: - Appearance: Clear - Color: Yellow - Specific Gravity: 1.012 - pH: 6.0 units - Protein: Negative - Glucose: Negative - Ketones: Negative - Blood: Negative - Nitrite: Negative - Leukocytes: Negative - Urobilinogen: Negative - Bilirubin: Negative  Pregnancy test: Not available in the provided results."

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, positive Rovsing's sign, elevated WBC count, and neutrophilia are highly suggestive of appendicitis. While the urinalysis is normal, making pyelonephritis less likely, a pregnancy test should still be obtained to definitively rule out a pregnancy-related complication.  However, even without the pregnancy test result, the current findings are sufficient to raise strong suspicion for appendicitis and warrant imaging.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the lesser trochanters. IV and oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were prepared.  DOSE: DLP: 633 mGy-cm  FINDINGS:  THORAX: The lung bases are clear bilaterally. The visualized heart and pericardium are normal.  LIVER: The liver is normal in size and attenuation. No focal hepatic lesions are identified. The portal vein is patent. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary duct dilatation.  GALLBLADDER: The patient is status post cholecystectomy with clips in the gallbladder fossa.  SPLEEN: The spleen is normal in size and enhancement.  PANCREAS: The pancreas shows normal enhancement. There is no pancreatic duct dilatation or peripancreatic fat stranding.  ADRENALS: The adrenal glands are unremarkable bilaterally.  KIDNEYS: The kidneys display symmetric nephrograms with no evidence of hydronephrosis or mass lesion in either kidney. The ureters are symmetrical in their course to the bladder.  BOWEL: The appendix is dilated up to 9 mm with enhancing wall. The appendix is fluid-filled with adjacent fat stranding consistent with ____. (Series 2, image 57 and series 601b, image 25) There is no evidence of appendiceal rupture or intra-abdominal fluid collection. The small bowel is normal appearing. The colon is unremarkable.  VESSELS: There is no aneurysmal dilatation of the abdominal aorta. The aorta and its major branches are patent.  LYMPH NODES: There are no pathologically enlarged retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph nodes by CT size criteria.  PELVIS: The bladder is unremarkable. There is mild diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon with no evidence of diverticulitis. The rectum is normal. There is no pelvic sidewall lymphadenopathy.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES/ SOFT TISSUES: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions seen in the visualized osseous structures."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, lab results, and imaging findings confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis. The CT scan shows a dilated appendix with enhancing wall, fluid filling, and adjacent fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis.  No rupture or abscess is noted.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated appendix with enhancing wall, fluid filling, and periappendiceal fat stranding. There is no evidence of rupture.  The rest of the abdominal and pelvic structures appear normal.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Ovarian Torsion (less likely given normal pelvic exam findings, though a formal pelvic exam was not documented)
4. Right ureteral calculus (less likely given normal urinalysis)
5. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (less likely given lack of fever and normal pelvic exam findings, though a formal pelvic exam was not documented)

Treatment:  Appendectomy is indicated given the confirmed diagnosis of acute appendicitis. This can be performed laparoscopically or via an open approach.  The patient should be given intravenous fluids, analgesics, and antibiotics (covering gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria) preoperatively.  Post-operative care should include pain management, monitoring for complications (such as infection or abscess formation), and early ambulation.  The patient should be advised to follow up with their physician for wound care and further management.
