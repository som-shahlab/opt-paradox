HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is y.o. ___ w/ no PMHx who presented on ___ w/  mild right lower quandarant pain for 5 days. The pain is  stabbing in nature, waxes and wanes, non radiating. Denies  fever/chills, night sweats,nausea,vomiting, anorexia,  constipation, diarrhea.     Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's presentation of mild right lower quadrant pain, several diagnoses are possible, including appendicitis, diverticulitis, or even a musculoskeletal issue.  I need more information to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on palpation of right lower quadrant, McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign,  rectal exam

ToolMessage:
"Admission Physical Exam ___: Vitals: 98.2 88 138/84 18 99% RA  GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: mildy tender to deep palpation at ___, non distended non peritoneal, negative Rovsign sing  Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain with tenderness to deep palpation but a non-peritoneal abdomen and negative Rovsing's sign.  While appendicitis is still possible, other diagnoses like diverticulitis, ovarian cysts, or even musculoskeletal pain are also possible. I will order some laboratory tests to help differentiate.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, urinalysis

ToolMessage:
"I'll help you organize the results for the requested tests:  CBC with differential: - White Blood Cells: 11.6 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 4.71 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 15.1 g/dL - Hematocrit: 45.0% - MCV: 96.0 fL - MCH: 32.0 pg - MCHC: 33.5% - RDW: 12.3% - Platelet Count: 241.0 K/uL - Differential:   - Neutrophils: 65.3%   - Lymphocytes: 25.2%   - Monocytes: 7.6%   - Eosinophils: 1.0%   - Basophils: 0.9%  CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel): - Sodium: 141.0 mEq/L - Potassium: 3.8 mEq/L - Chloride: 103.0 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 29.0 mEq/L - Calcium: 9.6 mg/dL - Glucose: Negative - Urea Nitrogen: 8.0 mg/dL - Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL - Estimated GFR: >75 mL/min/1.73 m\u00b2  Urinalysis: - Color: Straw - Appearance: Clear - pH: 6.5 units - Specific Gravity: 1.031 - Protein: Trace - Glucose: Negative - Ketones: Trace - Blood: Negative - Nitrite: Negative - Leukocytes: Negative - WBC: 0.0 #/hpf - RBC: 0.0 #/hpf - Epithelial Cells: 0.0 #/hpf - Bacteria: Few - Yeast: None - Mucous: Rare - Urobilinogen: Negative - Bilirubin: Negative  All requested tests are available and their results are provided above."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The laboratory results show a slightly elevated white blood cell count, but otherwise are unremarkable.  The urinalysis is also normal.  Given the persistent right lower quadrant pain, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is warranted to further evaluate for appendicitis, diverticulitis, or other causes of abdominal pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT scan of abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT scan of abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Multidetector CT images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with oral and intravenous contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformations were also performed. DLP: 343.30 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: The lung bases appear clear. There are no pleural effusions.  CT ABDOMEN: The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands and kidneys appear within normal limits. The stomach, small and large bowel appear within normal limits. In the right lower quadrant, the appendix is dilated and fluid-filled with a hyperenhancing wall and surrounding fat stranding which is fairly dense. Findings are consistent with ____. There is no evidence for extraluminal air or abscess formation.  CT PELVIS: The distal ureters, bladder, seminal vesicles and prostate appear within normal limits. The major mesenteric arteries and veins appear widely patent. There are no enlarged lymph nodes or ascites.  BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or blastic bone lesions."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated and fluid-filled appendix with a hyperenhancing wall and surrounding fat stranding.  I have enough information to recommend surgical consultation for appendectomy.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a dilated and fluid-filled appendix with a hyperenhancing wall and surrounding fat stranding.  This is consistent with acute appendicitis.  Given the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings, surgical intervention is indicated.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Diverticulitis
3. Ovarian Cyst
4. Musculoskeletal Pain
5. Mesenteric Adenitis

Treatment:  The patient should be made NPO and started on IV fluids.  Consult surgery for an appendectomy.  Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics such as Cefoxitin or Cefotetan for surgical prophylaxis.  Provide pain control with IV opioids as needed.  Monitor vital signs and laboratory values.  Post-operatively, continue antibiotics as indicated by surgical team.  Advance diet as tolerated.  Provide discharge instructions regarding wound care, pain management, and follow-up.
