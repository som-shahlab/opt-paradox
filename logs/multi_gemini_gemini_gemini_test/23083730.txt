HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This is an otherwise healthy ___ man who presents with acute onset of lower abdominal pain, starting at 2pm yesterday. The pain was suprapubic, crampy, non-radiating. Was worse with movement. He has not wanted to eat since the pain began. He did have some nausea and 2 episodes nonbloody/non-bilious emesis. No diarrhea, no fevers/chills.   Past Medical History: UTI hypospadias surgery   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. These symptoms could indicate a range of conditions, including appendicitis, gastroenteritis, or a urinary tract issue given his history of hypospadias surgery.  I need more information to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, and assessment of bowel sounds), costovertebral angle tenderness

ToolMessage:
"ADMISSION EXAM: Vitals: 100.5 84 130/81 18 100% RA  GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, TTP in RLQ, +Rosving, -  obturator/psoas. No rebound, no guarding Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused ."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia, with a history of hypospadias surgery.  Physical exam reveals right lower quadrant tenderness, positive Rovsing's sign, and low-grade fever. These findings raise strong suspicion for appendicitis. While his past medical history of hypospadias surgery raises the possibility of a urinary tract issue, the constellation of findings points more towards appendicitis. I will order imaging to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast report. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases to the lesser trochanters after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were prepared.  FINDINGS:  CT ABDOMEN: The lung bases are clear. The visualized portions of the heart and pericardium are unremarkable. The liver enhances homogenously and there is no focal liver lesion. The hepatic and portal veins are patent. The gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenals are normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast without evidence of hydronephrosis or mass. The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable. There is no portacaval, mesenteric, or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. There is no free air or free fluid.  CT PELVIS: The appendix is borderline in size measuring 7 to 8 mm. However, there is surrounding fat stranding and hyperemia (601:44). Air is seen within what appears to be the more proximal appendix (601B:42). There is no free air or free fluid. The colon, rectum, seminal vesicles, prostate, and urinary bladder are normal.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no lytic or blastic lesion worrisome for malignancy."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with acute lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and physical exam findings of right lower quadrant tenderness, positive Rovsing's sign, and low-grade fever suggested appendicitis. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, showing a borderline enlarged appendix with surrounding fat stranding and hyperemia, along with air within the proximal appendix. These findings are consistent with acute appendicitis.
