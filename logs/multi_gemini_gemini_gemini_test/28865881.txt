HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ qho presented with RLQ pain, onset 1 day, associated with  anorexia. No nausea, vomiting, fever, chills. Pain worsened over  course of day. No clear aggravating or alleviating factors. Pain  was ___ at its worst, improvement with morphine.     Past Medical History: PMH: none  PSH: none    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain, anorexia, and worsening pain over one day. This presentation is concerning for appendicitis.  However, the lack of fever, nausea, and vomiting makes the diagnosis less clear.  A physical exam focused on the abdomen is necessary to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness localized to the right lower quadrant.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam, including palpation for tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, McBurney's point tenderness, Psoas sign, Obturator sign;  Vital signs, including temperature

ToolMessage:
"PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION VITALS: Temp: 98.0 HR: 80 BP: 111/74 Resp: 16 O(2)Sat: 97 Normal GEN: A&Ox3, NAD RESP: Clear to auscultation CARD: Regular Rate and Rhythm GU/Flank: No costovertebral angle tenderness Extr/Back: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema Skin: No rash Abdominal: significant tenderness at ___, +mild Psoas  sign  PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION VITALS: Temp: 98.6 HR: 66 BP: 118/74 Resp: 20 O(2)Sat: 100%  Normal GEN: A&Ox3, NAD RESP: Clear to auscultation CARD: Regular Rate and Rhythm GU/Flank: No costovertebral angle tenderness Extr/Back: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema Skin: No rash Abdominal: soft, non-distended, appropriate incisional  tenderness, BS active"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, anorexia, and worsening pain, concerning for appendicitis. The physical exam reveals significant tenderness at ___ (likely RLQ given the initial complaint) and a mild psoas sign, which further increases the suspicion for appendicitis.  While the patient lacks fever, nausea, and vomiting, the localized tenderness and psoas sign in the context of RLQ pain are highly suggestive.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis would help confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT) DLP: 601 mGy-cm CTDIvol: 35 mGy  FINDINGS: Lungs: The lungs are clear, there is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The heart size is normal.  Abdomen: The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and display prompt contrast excretion. The appendix is dilated to 11 mm with a thickened hyperemic wall and surrounding stranding, consistent with ____. A 10 mm appendicolith seen at the base of the appendix. No abscess or extraluminal air is seen. The stomach and small bowel are decompressed and normal. The large bowel contains stool but is otherwise unremarkable. There is no intra-abdominal free air or free fluid.  Pelvis: The bladder is well distended and normal appearing. The prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable. No pathologically enlarged pelvic sidewall or inguinal lymph nodes are seen. There is no pelvic free fluid.  Vessels: The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. Its major branches are patent.  Bones: No blastic or lytic lesions suspicious for malignancy or infection."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with RLQ pain, anorexia, and worsening pain. Physical exam revealed significant tenderness at ___ (likely RLQ) and a mild psoas sign, raising suspicion for appendicitis.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, showing a dilated appendix (11 mm) with a thickened hyperemic wall, surrounding stranding, and an appendicolith – all classic findings of appendicitis.  No abscess or perforation is noted, which is important for surgical planning.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with RLQ pain, anorexia, and worsening pain over one day.  Physical exam revealed significant tenderness at ___ (likely RLQ) and a mild psoas sign.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, showing a dilated appendix (11 mm) with a thickened hyperemic wall, surrounding stranding, and an appendicolith – all classic findings of acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Cyst (if female)
3. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (if female)
4. Mesenteric Adenitis
5. Right Ureteral Stone

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment. This can be performed laparoscopically or via an open approach.  Preoperatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics (covering gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, such as cefoxitin or a combination of metronidazole and ceftriaxone).  Post-operatively, the patient should receive pain control, continue antibiotics as indicated, and be monitored for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  The patient should be educated on wound care and follow-up appointments.
