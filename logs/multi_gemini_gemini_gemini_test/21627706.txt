HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old male a history of IBS who presents to the emergency  department at the request of his primary doctor with 3 days of  isolated right lower quadrant abdominal pain. He recently played softball but has had no trauma. He ___ any fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. He has a history of IBS and states that his stools are baseline. He ___ any melena or hematochezia. He is tender to palpation.      Past Medical History:  Hypothyroidism    - IBS (with loose stools)    - ? self-reported overactive bladder, urinates ___ times per  day    - car accident in ___ that resulted in C6-C7 disc herniation      Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain. Given the history of IBS, it is important to differentiate between an IBS flare and other potential causes of abdominal pain such as appendicitis.  I need more information about the patient's current symptoms, vital signs, and the character of the pain to narrow the differential diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, obturator sign, psoas sign),  assess for guarding and rebound tenderness

ToolMessage:
"___ upon admission   Temp: 98.7 HR: 92 BP: 115/87 Resp: 19 O(2)Sat: 100 Normal   Constitutional:   General: The patient is awake and in no apparent distress. ENT: The head is atraumatic and normocephalic. Cranial nerves II through XII are grossly intact. Eyes: EOMI, Pupils are equal round and reactive to light. Neck: Supple, no lymphadenopathy Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2 Lungs: clear to auscultation bilaterally Abdomen: Soft, tenderness to palpation at ___ without guarding, nondistended, no palpable organomegaly Extremities: Warm and well perfused, no cyanosis. Back: no midline TTP, no CVAT Neuro: Awake, alert, follows commands, no focal deficits, cranial nerves are symmetric"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, with tenderness to palpation in the RLQ on exam but no guarding.  While his vital signs are stable and within normal limits, and the lack of guarding is somewhat reassuring, appendicitis still needs to be ruled out.  IBS is also a possibility given his history.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast would help visualize the appendix and rule out other serious causes of abdominal pain.  Lab tests would also be helpful to look for signs of infection or inflammation.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show elevated urine protein and glucose, which could indicate diabetes or kidney issues. However, the rest of the labs, including serum glucose and creatinine, are normal. The hazy urine may be explained by the mucus and few bacteria present.  The patient's abdominal exam shows tenderness in the RLQ without guarding. Given the ongoing concern for appendicitis, I will order a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast to evaluate the appendix and surrounding structures.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast.  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 567 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits. PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding. SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions. Incidental note is made of a 1.8 cm splenule. ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape. URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality. GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is fluid-filled and dilated up to 1.1 cm with wall thickening, hyperemia, and a moderate amount of periappendiceal fat stranding. There is no drainable fluid collection or extraluminal gas to suggest perforation. There is mild focal thickening at the base of the cecum as well, likely reactive.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain. His vital signs were normal, and the physical exam revealed tenderness to palpation in the RLQ without guarding.  Laboratory tests were largely unremarkable, except for elevated urine protein and glucose, which may warrant further investigation but are not directly related to his chief complaint. The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast reveals a fluid-filled and dilated appendix with wall thickening, hyperemia, and periappendiceal fat stranding, consistent with acute appendicitis.  Although there is no evidence of perforation, the findings clearly point to appendicitis as the cause of the patient's symptoms.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
