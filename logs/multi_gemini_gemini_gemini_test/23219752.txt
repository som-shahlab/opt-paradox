HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ who presents with several days of RUQ pain worse after eating fatty meals. The pain started 3 days ago after eating  pork chops and resolved on ___ overnight. He had oatmeal witout  issues the following morning. The pain returned after having steak and fries. The pain improved overnight and returned the following  day after having pizza. The pain persisted and he decided to seek medical attention. He is from ___ and was planning to return tomorrow. He does have subjective fevers, chills, nausea. No changes in bowel habits. He had had episodes of pain like this  in the past after meals.     Past Medical History: PMH: asthma, HTN  PSH: none    Social History: ___ Family History: non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's RUQ pain worsening after fatty meals suggests biliary colic or cholecystitis.  Given the recurrent nature of the pain and the association with fatty food intake, it's important to evaluate for gallstones and assess the presence of inflammation or infection in the gallbladder.  The patient's subjective fevers, chills, and nausea further support the possibility of cholecystitis.  I need to visualize the gallbladder and assess its function, as well as rule out other potential causes of RUQ pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested abdominal ultrasound matches the available LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) study. Here is the full report:  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN) RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND: The liver demonstrates homogeneous echogenicity without focal lesion. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The pancreatic head and neck are within normal limits. Evaluation of the body and tail is obscured by overlying bowel gas. The spleen is unremarkable and measures 12 cm. A single view of the right kidney shows no hydronephrosis. Multiple small stones and possibly polyps are seen within the gallbladder. Additionally, there is gallbladder distension, wall edema (9mm), minimal pericholecystic fluid, and a positive sonographic ___ sign, findings concerning for ____. The common bile duct measures 4 mm and is not dilated."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain worsened by fatty meals, a classic presentation of biliary colic or cholecystitis.  His history of similar episodes further supports this. The ultrasound confirms the presence of gallstones, gallbladder wall thickening, pericholecystic fluid, and a positive sonographic Murphy's sign, all highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis.  The presence of fever, chills, and nausea further strengthens this diagnosis. While other causes of RUQ pain are possible, the ultrasound findings combined with the clinical picture make acute cholecystitis the most likely diagnosis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Cholecystitis
2. Biliary Colic
3. Choledocholithiasis
4. Pancreatitis
5. Gastritis

Treatment:  The patient requires admission for management of acute cholecystitis. This includes:
* NPO status initially, followed by a gradual progression to a low-fat diet.
* IV fluids for hydration.
* Pain management with analgesics (e.g., NSAIDs or opioids).
* Intravenous antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., ceftriaxone and metronidazole) are indicated.
* Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment and should be performed ideally within 24-72 hours of admission.  If surgery is delayed, consider percutaneous cholecystostomy as a temporizing measure, especially in high-risk surgical candidates.  Consult surgery for evaluation and management.
