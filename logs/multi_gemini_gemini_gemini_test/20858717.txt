HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old male with a pmh significant for a-fib, DVT and  saddle PE on warfarin who has had known biliary stones and  recurrent abdominal pain which has been consistent with biliary  colic, who presented with acute onset, constant, severe,  abdominal pain.   His pain was located in the epigastrum. It started at 12pm on  ___ and has been constant. He had associated emesis x2, no  nausea, radiation of the pain to his back. No shortness of  breath or chest pain. He has noted slight darkening of his  urine, no change in stool habits or color. No hematochezia, or  hematemesis.   He is comfortable in bed, though he has a headache and abdominal  pain. Morphine in the ___ helped.  In the ED:  VS: 4 98.1 68 151/95 18 85% know to be at baseline   VS transfer: ___ 151/94 17 95% Nasal Cannula  Meds: none Fluids: none Received morphine and zofran at ___.  He reports having a recent stress test - cardiologists office  has most recent as ___.  ROS: (+) per HPI, 10 system ROS otherwise negative   Past Medical History: 1. DVT in ___ and PE in ___ (Saddle embolus) 2. Atrial fibrillation 3. Angina 4. Depression 5. NIDDM 6. GERD 7. HTN 8. Nephrolithiasis 9. Asthma    Social History: ___ Family History: Mom and sister with gallstones


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with acute, constant, severe epigastric pain radiating to the back, along with a history of biliary stones, raises concern for acute pancreatitis or other biliary complications like cholecystitis or cholangitis.  Given his history of a-fib, DVT, and PE, it's also important to consider other potential causes of abdominal pain, such as mesenteric ischemia or even an atypical presentation of an acute coronary syndrome.  I need lab tests to assess for pancreatic and liver injury/inflammation and a complete blood count to assess for infection or bleeding.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's significantly elevated lipase confirms acute pancreatitis. The mildly elevated ALT and AST suggest some hepatic involvement, possibly due to gallstone-related processes.  The elevated white blood cell count is consistent with the inflammatory process of pancreatitis.  The patient also has low hemoglobin, which could be chronic or could indicate a bleed. I will order an abdominal CT with contrast to evaluate the pancreas and surrounding structures, assess for complications of pancreatitis, and rule out other abdominal pathology.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal CT with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The closest match to an abdominal CT with contrast from the available studies is the CTA ABD & PELVIS (CT) report. Here is the full report:  CTA ABD & PELVIS (CT): EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS W/O CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial multidetector CT images through the abdomen and pelvis with and without intravenous contrast. Multiplanar reformations. DLP: 2835 mGy-cm  FINDINGS: Lower chest: Limited view of the lung bases is notable for small left and trace right pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  CT abdomen: The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesions or biliary dilatation. Multiple stones are present in a nondistended gallbladder. Moderate fat stranding is seen adjacent to the head, body, and tail of the pancreas. The pancreas enhances uniformly. There is no pancreatic ductal dilatation. The mixed density fluid collection extends from the inferior aspect of the body and tail of the pancreas along the left paracolic gutter into the pelvis measuring 18.3 x 8.5 x 29.7 cm (AP x TRV x CC) and consistent with a hematoma, new from the prior MRCP (3:53, 13:79, 15:58). There is no jet of contrast on the arterial phase or pooling of contrast in the venous phase associated with this collection to suggest active extravasation at the time of the scan. The spleen is not large enhances homogeneously. A small amount of hemorrhagic fluid is seen tracking along the spleen (13:45). Kidneys enhance symmetrically. There is no hydronephrosis. Multiple simple and hemorrhagic cysts are present in the right kidney as better evaluated on the MRI from 5 days prior. The adrenal glands are within normal limits.  Stomach and loops of small bowel are largely collapsed. The descending colon is compressed and displaced laterally by the adjacent large hematoma. The colon is otherwise unremarkable. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. Abdominal aorta is of normal caliber and its major branch vessels are patent. An IVC filter is noted. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  CT pelvis: The bladder, seminal vesicles, and prostate gland are unremarkable. A moderate amount of free fluid is present in the cul-de-sac. Note is made of sigmoid diverticulosis without diverticulitis. There is no inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymphadenopathy. A fat containing left inguinal hernia is noted.  Bone window: Severe multilevel degenerative changes are present in the spine. No concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions however is identified.  Extensive fat stranding in the left flank is likely due to retroperitoneal hemorrhage dissecting through the facial planes.  NOTIFICATION: Findings and recommendations were discussed by Dr. ___ ___ with Dr. ___ , on ___ at 1:45 pm, in person, 5 minutes after discovery."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, lab results showing significantly elevated lipase, and the CT findings of peripancreatic fat stranding and fluid collection confirm the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis. The CT also reveals a large hematoma, likely retroperitoneal, which explains the patient's low hemoglobin.  The presence of gallstones in a non-distended gallbladder suggests that gallstones are the likely cause of the pancreatitis.  There is no evidence of active extravasation at the time of the scan, and the patient is hemodynamically stable, so urgent intervention for the hematoma is not indicated.  The patient's history of DVT/PE and the presence of an IVC filter are noted.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Pancreatitis (Gallstone-induced)
2. Retroperitoneal Hematoma
3. Biliary Colic
4. Anemia (likely secondary to hematoma)
5. Atrial Fibrillation

Treatment:
* Admit the patient to the hospital for monitoring and supportive care.
* Make the patient NPO (nothing by mouth).
* Administer intravenous fluids (e.g., Lactated Ringer's) to maintain hydration and electrolyte balance.
* Provide adequate pain control with intravenous analgesics (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone).
* Monitor vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate, closely.
* Monitor hemoglobin and hematocrit levels for any further decline.
* Consult with gastroenterology for evaluation and management of gallstones and pancreatitis.
* Consult with surgery to evaluate the retroperitoneal hematoma and determine if intervention is necessary.
* Hold warfarin given the active bleeding.  Discuss bridging anticoagulation with heparin with the consulting physicians once the bleeding has stopped.
* Monitor for signs of infection or other complications of pancreatitis (e.g., pseudocyst, abscess).
* Consider an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) if there is evidence of biliary obstruction or cholangitis.
* Once the patient's condition stabilizes, initiate a low-fat diet and gradually advance as tolerated.
* Discuss long-term management of gallstones (e.g., cholecystectomy) after the acute pancreatitis resolves.
