InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs are normal, and although I could not obtain a urinalysis, I will now order imaging to evaluate the appendix given the patient's persistent RLQ pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen/Pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT Abdomen/Pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  STUDY: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast; 130 cc of Omnipaque intravenous contrast was administered without adverse reaction or complication. Oral contrast was also administered. Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were also generated.  FINDINGS:  ABDOMEN: The visualized portions of the lung bases are clear. The liver shows no focal lesion or intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder shows no stones or wall edema. The spleen is normal size. The pancreas and adrenal glands show no masses or nodules. Kidneys enhance with and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis. The small and large bowel show no evidence of obstruction or wall edema. The appendix is visualized and is prominent in size measuring 9 mm in caliber. It demonstrates equivocal wall edema and minimal surrounding inflammation. A few scattered lymph nodes are present in the right lower quadrant in the mesentery. The overall appearance of this appendix is similar to slightly progressed compared to that on prior exam. There is no organized fluid collection or free fluid. There is no free air.  PELVIS: The bladder, prostate and rectum appear unremarkable. There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.  BONES: There are no aggressive-appearing lytic or sclerotic lesions."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with persistent right lower quadrant pain.  Labs are normal.  CT scan shows a prominent appendix measuring 9mm with equivocal wall edema and minimal surrounding inflammation, slightly progressed from a prior scan.  Given the patient's presentation, history, and imaging findings, the patient likely has appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with persistent right lower quadrant pain.  Labs are normal.  CT scan shows a prominent appendix measuring 9mm with equivocal wall edema and minimal surrounding inflammation, slightly progressed from a prior scan.  These findings are concerning for appendicitis.  Given the patient's persistent pain and concerning imaging findings, I recommend surgical consultation for possible appendectomy.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Early Appendicitis
3. Mesenteric adenitis
4. Typhlitis
5. Cecal Diverticulitis

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for possible appendectomy.  Continue IV fluids.  Administer pain medication as needed.  Monitor vital signs and labs.  If surgery is not indicated, the patient should be discharged with instructions to return if symptoms worsen or new symptoms develop.  The patient should also be educated on the signs and symptoms of appendicitis.
