InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, BRBPR, and a CT showing descending and sigmoid wall thickening concerning for infection/inflammation/ischemia. Given her history of NSCLC and pneumonectomy, it's important to consider a broad differential including infectious colitis, ischemic colitis, diverticulitis, and other inflammatory processes.  I need further information to narrow down the diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation suggests possible infectious colitis, ischemic colitis, or diverticulitis. The CT findings of sigmoid wall thickening support these possibilities.  The lab results show leukocytosis with neutrophilia, but normal lactate, which argues against severe ischemia or sepsis.  Blood cultures, stool studies, and fecal calprotectin will help differentiate between infectious and inflammatory causes.  Since the patient has received antibiotics, it's important to reassess her abdominal pain and look for signs of peritonitis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam (assessing for tenderness, guarding, rebound, distension), vital signs

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient continues to have RLQ tenderness, guarding, and mild rebound, suggesting localized peritonitis.  While the initial lactate was normal, the persistent pain and leukocytosis raise concern for ongoing inflammation or infection.  The combination of BRBPR, sigmoid wall thickening, and now RLQ findings makes diverticulitis the most likely diagnosis.  However, ischemic colitis remains a possibility.  The lack of gross blood on rectal exam is not reassuring, and further evaluation is needed.  Given the patient's history of pneumonectomy and potential for complications, surgical consultation is warranted.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: This patient presents with RLQ pain, BRBPR, and CT findings of sigmoid wall thickening. Her leukocytosis with left shift suggests an inflammatory or infectious process. While ischemic colitis is possible, her lactate is normal. The abdominal exam reveals tenderness, guarding, and mild rebound in the RLQ, raising concern for localized peritonitis.  Diverticulitis is the most likely diagnosis given the location of pain, CT findings, and exam.  Infectious colitis remains possible, though less likely given the localized findings. Ischemic colitis is less likely given the normal lactate.  Appendicitis is unlikely given a normal appendix on CT.  Pneumonia is unlikely given clear left lung sounds and the abdominal findings.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Diverticulitis with possible localized peritonitis
2. Infectious colitis
3. Ischemic colitis
4. Appendicitis
5. Pneumonia

Treatment: Admit for IV antibiotics (e.g., ciprofloxacin and metronidazole), bowel rest, and serial abdominal exams.  Monitor for worsening symptoms or signs of peritonitis.  Surgical consultation if no improvement or if signs of peritonitis worsen.  Obtain stool studies and blood cultures to further evaluate for infectious etiology.  If symptoms improve, transition to oral antibiotics and advance diet as tolerated.  Consider a colonoscopy after resolution of the acute episode to evaluate for underlying pathology.
