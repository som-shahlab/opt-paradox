Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ yo M with COPD on 2L home O2, CHF, Afib not on Coumadin,  pacemaker, DM2 presenting with abdominal pain. He had 3 episodes  of abdominal discomfort over the past couple of months, each  lasting for hours, associated with yawning, and without any  clear association with meals. The patient developed severe  abdominal pain during dinner last night at around 9 p.m. When he  tried to get up, he became dizzy and had to lie down. He had one  episode of non-bloody emesis and presented to ___ for  further evaluation. . The patient reports abdominal pain as his primary symptoms, but  per ___ records, dyspnea was his chief complaint  there. At ___, the patient was found to be hypotensive  to the ___. His blood pressure rapidly improved with IV fluids.  Labs showed creat 1.2, Dbili 0.6, tbili 1.3, AST 182, ALT 137,  amylase 1819, lipase >3000, troponin T 0.02 (neg), wbc 22, hct  46.5, plt 271 INR 0.96, digoxin 1.06, u/a neg. ABG ___ on  2L NC. CT chest/abdomen with IV contrast showed non specific  gallbladder wall thickening, mild to moderate fluid and  stranding around the pancreas, no PE.

Surgery was consulted and recommended ERCP, IV  fluids, antibiotics, with likely cholecystectomy in the future.  He was given morphine 4 mg IV and Unasyn 3 gm IV. . On transfer to the ICU, vital signs were 127/54, 76, 20, 99% 3L  nc. He has 2 18-gauge peripheral IVs for access. .   On arrival to the ICU, the patient complaind of abdominal pain.  He denies nausea, but has had a total of 2 episodes of  non-bloody emesis, one at home and one in the ED. He had a soft  BM this a.m. He had some shortness of breath initially but now  feels that his breathing is at baseline.   Past Medical History: CHF - details unclear COPD (2L home O2) DMII a-fib (not on Coumadin) s/p pacemaker s/p appendectomy ___ years ago s/p bilateral inguinal hernias "Bright's disease" at age ___   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory

Thought: This patient with multiple comorbidities presents with acute abdominal pain concerning for acute pancreatitis. Given the patient's history of gallstones and dilated common bile duct, gallstone pancreatitis is the likely etiology.  However, I need to gather more information to assess the severity of pancreatitis, rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain, and evaluate the patient's overall clinical status.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: This patient has confirmed acute pancreatitis likely secondary to gallstones given the significantly elevated lipase, dilated common bile duct, and gallstones on ultrasound.  The patient also has acute kidney injury likely due to dehydration from vomiting and poor oral intake in the setting of pancreatitis.  The metabolic abnormalities and elevated WBC suggest the patient may have an infection or systemic inflammatory response.  I have enough information to provide a reasonable differential diagnosis and treatment plan.
