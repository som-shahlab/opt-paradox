HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ M complaining of dull, diffuse, crampy abdominal and non bloody diarrhea since ___ (4 days ago) in the RLQ. For the  past 2 days it has become sharper and worse in quality, with  radiation to RLQ. He denies nausea, but has had anorexia since ___ and is also complaining of aches in his buttocks and thigh.  No emesis, dyuria, or urinary frequency. His last BM was on ___. He has no history of prior abdominal surgery.    Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain and diarrhea, which could indicate a range of gastrointestinal issues, including appendicitis, gastroenteritis, or inflammatory bowel disease. Given the location and migration of the pain, appendicitis is a key differential.  I need to gather more information through physical examination to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign, rebound tenderness, abdominal guarding,  assess for fever

ToolMessage:
"On admission:  Temp 98.2, HR 75 BP115/87 RR16. 97 Room air GenL: NAD, AOX3 CV: RRR Resp: CTAB Abd: Positive for peritonitis, particularly in RLQ Ext: No ___ edema"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain migrating to the RLQ, diarrhea, anorexia, and myalgias.  The physical exam reveals peritoneal signs, localizing to the RLQ.  These findings strongly suggest appendicitis. While further imaging could be considered, the clinical picture is highly suggestive, and delaying surgical intervention to obtain imaging may be harmful.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a chief complaint of dull, diffuse, crampy abdominal pain and non-bloody diarrhea for four days, localized to the right lower quadrant (RLQ). The pain has worsened over the past two days, becoming sharper and radiating to the RLQ.  He also reports anorexia, buttock and thigh aches.  The absence of nausea, vomiting, dysuria, or urinary frequency is noted.  The patient has no prior abdominal surgeries.

While other conditions like gastroenteritis or inflammatory bowel disease could cause abdominal pain and diarrhea, the localized RLQ pain, peritoneal signs, and absence of other symptoms make these less likely.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Mesenteric adenitis
4. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohn's disease)
5. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) - less likely given the lack of urinary symptoms and the specific RLQ findings.

Treatment:  The treatment for acute appendicitis is appendectomy.  This should be performed expeditiously to prevent complications such as perforation or abscess formation.  Pre-operative care should include intravenous fluids, pain management, and prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of metronidazole and ceftriaxone) to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.  Post-operative care involves wound management, pain control, and monitoring for complications such as infection or ileus.
