HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ presenting with RLQ pain for the last 3 days  with increasing intensity in the last day. Denies nausea,  vomiting, fevers, or chills.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: H pylori, chronic epididymitis, GERD  Past Surgical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory - no colon cancer in the family.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain of increasing intensity. Given the location of the pain, appendicitis is high on the differential diagnosis. Other possibilities include diverticulitis, kidney stones, inguinal hernia, or testicular torsion.  I need to gather more information to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on RLQ tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign, Murphy's sign,  rectal exam, testicular exam

ToolMessage:
"Admission: Vitals: 98.5 109 171/82 16 100% RA  GEN: A&O x3, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, minimally tender in the RLQ. No rebound or guarding Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain. While the abdominal exam shows minimal tenderness in the RLQ, and no rebound or guarding, I still need to rule out appendicitis and other serious conditions.  The lack of fever, nausea, and vomiting lowers the suspicion for appendicitis, but does not rule it out. Imaging is necessary to further evaluate the RLQ pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Multi detector CT images through the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after the uneventful administration of intravenous contrast. No oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were generated and reviewed. DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 375 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: Chest: The bases of the lungs are clear. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  Abdomen: The liver appears homogeneous in attenuation without a focal lesion identified. A small hypodensity within the right hepatic lobe is too small to characterize (02:13), potentially an hepatic cyst or biliary hamartomas. Portal veins appear patent. There is no intrahepatic biliary duct dilation. There is no radiopaque cholelithiasis. The pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys present symmetric nephrograms and excretion of contrast. Multiple bilateral cortical renal hypo densities are too small to characterize, the largest within the interpolar region of the right kidney which measures approximately 6 mm (02:17). There is no hydronephrosis or perinephric fluid collection. Bilateral extra renal pelvis these are noted. The stomach, duodenum, and loops of small bowel are grossly unremarkable. The appendix is visualized, fluid-filled and measures 8 mm in maximum caliber at its tip (601b:30). ___ appendiceal fat stranding is mild. At the base of the appendix is a 1.6 x 1.8 cm rim enhancing fluid collection (601b:25). Stool fills the rectum which is otherwise unremarkable. A minimally distended loop of small bowel within the left lower quadrant demonstrates fecalized loop of bowel suggestive of slow transit (02:46) likely reactive focal ileus. The abdominal aorta demonstrates minimal atherosclerotic calcifications without aneurysmal dilatation. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric adenopathy.  Pelvis: The bladder is distended and grossly unremarkable. Prostate gland and seminal vesicles are within normal limits in appearance. There is no pelvic free fluid. There is no inguinal or pelvic sidewall pathologically enlarged nodes. A right hydrocele is noted. Osseous structures are without a worrisome lesion suggestive of malignancy or infection.  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the ___ ___ at 12:22 ___, 2 minutes after discovery of the findings."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan reveals an 8mm fluid-filled appendix with mild periappendiceal fat stranding and a 1.6 x 1.8 cm rim-enhancing fluid collection at the base of the appendix.  These findings are highly suggestive of appendicitis.  The patient's clinical presentation of RLQ pain, along with these imaging findings, makes appendicitis the most likely diagnosis.
