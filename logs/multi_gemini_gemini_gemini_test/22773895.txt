HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ who presents to her urgent care clinic today with lower abdominal pain for the last 8 days. The pain is constant and has not changed in character in the last 8 days. The pain is associated with nausea and anorexia. She denies any sick contacts. She does have chills but denies fevers, vomiting, diarrhea. She does have constipation (last BM was yesterday).  She never had pain like this before. She denies use of NSAIDS. She had a colonoscopy ___ year ago which was reportedly significant  for a benign polyp.     Past Medical History: Denies   Family History: Noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's presentation of lower abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, chills, and constipation, several diagnostic possibilities need to be considered. These include appendicitis, diverticulitis, ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, or other gastrointestinal issues.  A physical exam is necessary to assess for tenderness, guarding, or other signs of localized infection or inflammation.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam, pelvic exam, vital signs

ToolMessage:
"Upon presentation to ___:  Temp:97.0 HR:73 BP:159/81 Resp:16 O(2)Sat:100 Normal   Constitutional: Comfortable HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, Extraocular muscles intact Chest: Clear to auscultation Cardiovascular: Regular Rate and Rhythm, Normal first and second heart sounds Abdominal: Soft, Nondistended mild lower abdominal tenderness right greater than left no rebound or guarding Pelvic: Per the resident's bilateral adnexal tenderness but no cervical motion tenderness and trace white"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with lower abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, chills, and constipation. While her vital signs are stable, the physical exam reveals mild lower abdominal tenderness, more pronounced on the right side, and bilateral adnexal tenderness without cervical motion tenderness.  The absence of rebound or guarding argues against acute appendicitis. The combination of lower abdominal pain, adnexal tenderness, and trace white discharge raises suspicion for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). However, other possibilities like ovarian cysts or other gynecological issues cannot be ruled out. Given the duration of symptoms (8 days), it's important to rule out more serious conditions.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs are largely unremarkable, except for moderate blood and 3-5 RBCs on urinalysis. This hematuria, combined with her abdominal pain, could indicate a kidney stone.  While her pain is not the classic colicky flank pain, kidney stones can sometimes present atypically.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is needed to visualize the kidneys and ureters and confirm or rule out this possibility.  Additionally, the results of the GC/Chlamydia testing and urine culture are still pending and could provide further insights.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis without contrast is not available in the provided list. The only available imaging study is a CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs are largely unremarkable except for moderate blood and 3-5 RBCs on urinalysis, suggesting possible kidney stones.  Her abdominal pain, while not classic renal colic, could still be consistent with a kidney stone.  Although a non-contrast CT is preferred for kidney stones, a CT with contrast is acceptable and can still help visualize the urinary tract and identify other potential causes of her symptoms.  Given the duration of symptoms, the lack of fever, and the normal white blood cell count, a serious infection appears less likely.  Pending GC/Chlamydia and urine culture results will help further refine the diagnosis.  A CT with contrast is the next best step.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT): CT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS PERFORMED ON ___.  TECHNIQUE: MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast only. Coronal and sagittal reformations were provided.  FINDINGS: LUNG BASES: The imaged lung bases are clear.  ABDOMEN: The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands appear normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly. The abdominal aorta and major branches appear widely patent. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  PELVIS: Loops of small bowel demonstrate no signs of ileus or obstruction. There is an appendicolith seen on series 2, image 54 at the base of the appendix and a dilated appendix measuring 12 mm in diameter with periappendiceal fat stranding. Findings best seen on series 301, image 27. Findings are compatible with acute uncomplicated ____. Lower quadrant reactive nodes are noted. The large bowel contains moderate fecal load. There is no evidence of diverticulosis or diverticulitis. The uterus and adnexal structures are grossly unremarkable. There is no pelvic free fluid.  BONES: Unremarkable."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan reveals an appendicolith, a dilated appendix measuring 12mm in diameter, and periappendiceal fat stranding, all highly suggestive of acute appendicitis. This explains the patient's lower abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, and chills. The mild lower abdominal tenderness, more pronounced on the right side, noted on physical exam further supports this diagnosis. While the patient doesn't exhibit rebound tenderness or guarding, these signs are not always present in early appendicitis. The absence of fever and the normal white blood cell count are also not unusual in early or contained appendicitis.  The bilateral adnexal tenderness noted on exam could be related to the proximity of the inflamed appendix to the pelvic structures. The hematuria noted on urinalysis is likely unrelated and could be due to menstruation or other benign causes.  The pending GC/Chlamydia and urine culture results are less relevant given the clear CT findings.  The patient's presentation and the CT findings are sufficient to make a diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

Thought: The CT scan reveals an appendicolith, a dilated appendix measuring 12mm in diameter, and periappendiceal fat stranding, all highly suggestive of acute appendicitis.  While the patient's presentation is atypical, lacking fever and exhibiting only mild tenderness, the CT findings are definitive.  The initial differential included PID, ovarian cysts, and kidney stones, but the CT clearly points to appendicitis as the cause of her symptoms.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute appendicitis
2. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID)
3. Ovarian cyst

5. Diverticulitis

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy.  Given the CT findings of acute uncomplicated appendicitis, a laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred approach.  She should be admitted to the hospital for intravenous fluids, pain management, and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem).  Post-operative care should include monitoring for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  She should be advised to follow up with her surgeon for wound care and further management.
