HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ F w/ minimal medical hx w/ one day of abdominal pain starting  yesterday morning crampy in nature and located in the mid  abdomen. Throughout the day, it localized to the RLQ and became  sharp ___. She reports that every bump during the car ride in  hurt. She endorses anorexia x1 day, nausea but no emesis. LMP  finished 4 days ago, on Mirena. Subjective fevers.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Denies  Past Surgical History: Denies    Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, concerning for appendicitis.  Given the patient's age and sex, other diagnoses on the differential include ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, and pelvic inflammatory disease. I need to gather more information to narrow down the diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign, vital signs including temperature, abdominal exam including palpation for rebound tenderness and guarding

ToolMessage:
"Physical Exam on admission: Vitals: 98.0, HR 74, BP 109/59, RR 16, 99% RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l ABD: Soft, obese, nondistended, tender RLQ, + Rosving's, +  Psoas, mild guarding.  Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, anorexia, nausea, and low-grade fever. Physical exam reveals RLQ tenderness, positive Rovsing's and Psoas signs, and mild guarding, highly suggestive of appendicitis.  While the patient has a Mirena IUD, ectopic pregnancy cannot be ruled out based on history and physical exam alone. Ovarian torsion and pelvic inflammatory disease remain less likely given the exam findings.  A pregnancy test and complete blood count are necessary to further refine the diagnosis.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: Urine hCG, CBC with differential

ToolMessage:
"I'll provide the results for the requested tests:  Urine hCG: - HCG, Urine, Qualitative: NEGATIVE  CBC with differential: - White Blood Cells: 12.4 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 4.48 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 13.1 g/dL - Hematocrit: 39.2% - MCV: 88.0 fL - MCH: 29.3 pg - MCHC: 33.5% - RDW: 13.1% - Platelet Count: 292.0 K/uL - Differential:   - Neutrophils: 71.7%   - Lymphocytes: 21.8%   - Monocytes: 4.5%   - Eosinophils: 1.9%   - Basophils: 0.1%  All requested tests are available in the laboratory results."

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, positive Rovsing's and Psoas signs, mild guarding, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and negative urine hCG strongly suggests appendicitis.  Other diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, ovarian torsion, and pelvic inflammatory disease are less likely given the clinical picture.  I am confident in recommending a surgical consult for suspected appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: This patient presents with classic symptoms of appendicitis: migrating abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, RLQ tenderness, positive Rovsing's and Psoas signs, and mild guarding.  The negative urine hCG effectively rules out ectopic pregnancy.  The elevated WBC with neutrophilia further supports the diagnosis of appendicitis.  While ovarian torsion and PID are less likely, they cannot be completely excluded.  Given the high probability of appendicitis, surgical consultation is warranted.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Torsion
3. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
4. Ectopic Pregnancy (unlikely given negative hCG)
5. Mesenteric Adenitis

Treatment: Consult surgery for evaluation and likely appendectomy.  Administer IV fluids for hydration.  Provide pain control with analgesics (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone).  Administer prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., cefoxitin or cefazolin plus metronidazole) preoperatively.  Continue to monitor vital signs and abdominal exam.  If surgery confirms appendicitis, postoperative care should include pain management, wound care, and monitoring for complications such as infection or abscess formation.
