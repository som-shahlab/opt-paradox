Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ healthy female with diffuse abdominal pain which woke her from sleep at 1am on day of presentation ___ pm). Pain is ___ throbbing pain that is occasionally sharp in the upper and lower abdomen, does not radiate to flank or groin, and hurts with movement. No worsening in her pain. She has had little appetite, but denies nausea or vomiting. She denies dysuria. Day of presentation had one episode non-bloody diarrhea, but none since, and reports last flatus yesterday. Multiple family  members have been had 'stomach bugs,' but not felt this sick. She presently feels bloated. Denies fevers or chills. Has not been sexually active for more than three months, started period yesterday and has negative uHCG. Reports history of pain on day prior to period so severe she often vomits and loses consciousness. Takes OCPs with periods once every three months.  She was seen by PCP at ___, and was referred for further evaluation when ___ found to be 24.    Past Medical History: Depression  PSH: none   Social History: ___ Family History: DM, thyroid disease (graves?), breast cancer, mom with adenomyosis. No history of GI cancers or GYN cancers.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with diffuse abdominal pain, bloating, and altered bowel habits. The pain's association with movement and the patient's reported bloating suggests possible peritoneal irritation.  The decreased appetite and single episode of diarrhea raise concern for an infectious etiology, possibly gastroenteritis, given the family history of similar symptoms. However, the severity of the pain, especially waking her from sleep, warrants further investigation to rule out more serious conditions like appendicitis, ovarian torsion, or other inflammatory processes. The patient's history of severe pain before menses, to the point of vomiting and loss of consciousness, is concerning and needs to be explored further, especially in relation to her current symptoms.  The fact that her PCP found an elevated finding (likely WBC given the referral) further supports the need for a thorough evaluation.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show a significantly elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia, which, combined with her symptoms, strongly suggests an acute inflammatory process. The presence of ketones in the urine may indicate dehydration or metabolic derangement related to her decreased oral intake and ongoing abdominal pain.  The absence of leukocytes, nitrites, or blood in the urine makes a urinary tract infection less likely.  While her lipase is normal, her bicarbonate is low, raising concern for possible pancreatitis or another process affecting her acid-base balance.  Given the severity of her pain, elevated WBC, and the need to visualize abdominal structures, imaging is warranted.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: Axial MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after the uneventful administration of oral and IV contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats were generated. Total exam DLP: 262 mGy-cm. CTDI: 18 mGy.  FINDINGS: Lung bases are clear. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  CT of the abdomen: The liver enhances homogeneously with no focal hepatic lesions identified. The gallbladder is normal. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The portal vein is patent. The adrenal glands are normal. The pancreas is normal. The spleen is homogeneous and normal in size. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast without evidence of hydronephrosis or renal masses.  The stomach is significantly distended and the majority of the contrast remains within the gastric fundus. There is no evidence of small bowel obstruction. Small and large bowel are grossly unremarkable. Evaluation is somewhat limited by lack of contrast in the cecum and lack of significant fat planes in the abdomen. A 10 mm appendix however is seen extending into the pelvis, containing an appendicolith and surrounded by fat stranding, consistent with ____. There are no signs to suggest perforation. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria. There is no intra-abdominal free air.  CT of the pelvis: The urinary bladder and terminal ureters are normal. The uterus and adnexa are within normal limits. There is a small amount of pelvic free fluid.  Osseous structures: No blastic or lytic lesion concerning for malignancy is present."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan reveals appendicitis, characterized by an appendicolith, periappendiceal fat stranding, and a dilated appendix. This finding explains her abdominal pain, elevated white blood cell count, and other symptoms. The small amount of pelvic free fluid is likely reactive and related to the appendicitis.  The lack of perforation is reassuring. The significantly distended stomach with contrast retained in the fundus suggests delayed gastric emptying, possibly related to the inflammatory process or pain. The remainder of the abdominal and pelvic structures appear normal.  Given the clear diagnosis of appendicitis on CT, no further information is needed.

This finding correlates with her clinical presentation of abdominal pain, elevated WBC count, and neutrophilia.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Ovarian Cyst
4. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
5. Constipation

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy. This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the surgeon's preference and the patient's condition.  Preoperatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids for hydration and pain management.  Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered to cover common enteric bacteria. Postoperatively, the patient should receive pain control, continue antibiotics as indicated, and be monitored for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  A follow-up appointment should be scheduled to monitor healing and remove sutures or staples if necessary.  The patient's history of severe pre-menstrual pain should also be addressed at a later appointment to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management.
