HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
MR. ___ is a ___ male who presents to the ED today complaining of right upper quadrant abdominal pain x2 days. He went to his outpatient PCP yesterday where ___ ultrasound revealed stones in a distended gallbladder and CBD 11mm, no evidence of gallbladder wall thickening or pericholecystic  fluid. His LFTs yesterday were normal. His PCP recommended he come to the ED for evaluation. He presented to the ED this morning and  is still complaining of some ___ pain without any nausea, vomiting, or other GI symptoms. Describes the pain as dull, constant, and with radiation to his back. Denies any fevers or chills. Had one prior similar episode at an OSH about a year ago and says he  "had a stone removed" at that time.  Upon admission to the medical service, he reports a mild  headache and mild ___ pain (___) that increases to ___ with  palpation.  He reports constipation since the day prior to  admission.  He otherwise feels well.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of biliary colic and a recent ultrasound showing gallstones and a dilated common bile duct (CBD). While his liver function tests (LFTs) were normal yesterday, his presentation with persistent right upper quadrant pain warrants further investigation to rule out complications like cholangitis or choledocholithiasis.  I need to assess his current LFTs and inflammatory markers. Additionally, given the dilated CBD, I need to visualize the biliary tree to confirm the presence of a stone in the CBD and assess for any obstruction.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's current LFTs, lipase, and CMP are largely normal, except for a mildly elevated white blood cell count and elevated glucose.  The absence of significantly elevated LFTs and lipase reduces the likelihood of acute cholangitis or pancreatitis. However, given the dilated CBD on the prior ultrasound and persistent pain,  imaging of the biliary tree is necessary to evaluate for choledocholithiasis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)

ToolMessage:
"Here is the MRCP report from the available imaging studies:  MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC):  TECHNIQUE: T1- and T2-weighted multiplanar images of the abdomen were acquired in a 1.5 T magnet. Intravenous contrast: 8 mL Gadavist Oral contrast: 1 cc of Gadavist mixed with 50 cc of water was administered for oral contrast.  FINDINGS: Lower Thorax: Lung bases are clear.  Liver /Biliary: Gallbladder is distended with wall edema. Pericholecystic fluid is noted extending along the inferior surface of the liver. Several gallstones are noted in the gallbladder. Intra and extrahepatic bile ducts are dilated. Common bile duct measures up to 11 mm. There is a focal signal void in the dilated cystic duct which may represent and obstructive gallstone. No choledocholithiasis is identified. Hyperemia of the liver parenchyma is noted surrounding the gallbladder in the early arterial phase. Hepatic steatosis is noted with fat fraction of 16%.  Pancreas: Pancreas has normal T1 intensity. Pancreatic duct is normal size.  Spleen: Unremarkable.  Adrenal Glands: Unremarkable.  Kidneys: Unremarkable.  Gastrointestinal Tract: A 28 x 14 mm duodenal diverticulum is identified.  Lymph Nodes: No lymphadenopathy.  Vasculature: Abdominal aorta is normal size.  Osseous and Soft Tissue Structures: No worrisome lesion is identified.  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed by Dr. ___ with Dr. ___ on the telephone on ___ at 4:00 ___, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain and a history of gallstones. Initial ultrasound showed gallstones and a dilated common bile duct (CBD).  Lab results showed mildly elevated white blood cells and glucose, but normal LFTs and lipase. The MRCP confirms the presence of gallstones, a dilated CBD, and pericholecystic fluid, but no choledocholithiasis. The findings suggest acute cholecystitis.  The presence of cystic duct obstruction by a gallstone explains the patient's symptoms. While the CBD is dilated, the absence of a stone in the CBD on MRCP suggests that the dilation is likely secondary to the cystic duct obstruction and resultant inflammation, rather than choledocholithiasis.  The patient's presentation, imaging findings, and lab results are consistent with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

Treatment:  The patient requires admission for acute cholecystitis. Treatment includes:
* NPO status
* Intravenous fluids
* Pain management with analgesics (e.g., NSAIDs, opioids if needed)
* Intravenous antibiotics (e.g., Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole) to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.
* Laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed within 24-72 hours of admission.  Surgical consultation should be obtained promptly.
* Management of other comorbidities:  Monitor blood glucose and adjust diabetic medications as needed.
