HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ female with RLQ pain which began yesterday. The pain was  initially located ___ before localizing to the RLQ.   She has had no previous episodes.  Pain is undulating, dull and  sharp (up to ___, increased when walking.  It does not  radiate.  She also reports nausea and anorexia without vomiting.   Her last meal was toast this morning.  ROS: (+) per HPI (-) Denies fevers night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue/malaise/lethargy, vomiting, hematemesis, bloating, cramping, melena, BRBPR, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, edema, urinary frequency, urgency   Past Medical History: PMH: Inflammatory bowel syndrome  PSH: None   Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with RLQ pain, nausea, and anorexia. The pain is worse with movement.  The differential diagnosis includes appendicitis, ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, and inflammatory bowel disease flare.  More information is needed to narrow the differential.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign), pelvic exam

ToolMessage:
"98.7 F   75    121/81   20    100% RA  GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender to light palpation in the RLQ,  no rebound or guarding, Rovsing's sign is not present, normoactive  bowel sounds, no palpable masses Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with RLQ pain, nausea, and anorexia. The pain is worse with movement.  Her temperature is normal.  The physical exam reveals tenderness in the RLQ, but no rebound, guarding, or Rovsing's sign.  The differential diagnosis includes appendicitis, ovarian torsion, ectopic pregnancy, and inflammatory bowel disease flare.  A pregnancy test and CBC are needed to further narrow the differential.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC, Urine hCG

ToolMessage:
"I'll provide the results for the requested CBC (Complete Blood Count) and Urine hCG tests:  CBC (Complete Blood Count) results: - White Blood Cells: 7.3 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 4.43 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 13.2 g/dL - Hematocrit: 39.3% - MCV: 89.0 fL - MCH: 29.8 pg - MCHC: 33.7% - RDW: 12.4% - Platelet Count: 288.0 K/uL  Urine hCG result: - HCG, Urine, Qualitative: NEGATIVE  All requested tests are available in the laboratory results, and I've provided their complete values above."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with RLQ pain, nausea, and anorexia. The pain is worse with movement.  Her temperature is normal. The physical exam reveals tenderness in the RLQ, but no rebound, guarding, or Rovsing's sign.  The CBC and urine hCG are normal.  An ultrasound is needed to evaluate for appendicitis, ovarian torsion, and other causes of RLQ pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested abdominal ultrasound is not available among the provided imaging studies. The only available study is a CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with RLQ pain, nausea, and anorexia. The pain is worse with movement.  Her temperature is normal. The physical exam reveals tenderness in the RLQ, but no rebound, guarding, or Rovsing's sign.  The CBC and urine hCG are normal.  An abdominal ultrasound was requested, but a CT abdomen/pelvis is available instead.  Given the patient's history and findings so far, a CT A/P with IV contrast is appropriate to evaluate for appendicitis and other causes of RLQ pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast study. Here is the full report:  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS: Helical imaging was performed from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis after intravenous and oral contrast administration. Sagittal and coronal reformats were prepared.  CT ABDOMEN: Partially visualized lung bases demonstrate bibasilar dependent atelectasis and partially visualized heart appears normal. The spleen, adrenals, pancreas, gallbladder, liver, and kidneys appear normal. No free air or free fluid is present. Bowel appears normal.  CT PELVIS: Oral contrast did not transit into the cecum limiting evaluation of the appendix. However, there is a small amount of simple fluid near the cecal base. The appendix is top normal in size measuring 7 mm (301B:13). There are no drainable fluid collections in the pelvis. There is trace fluid in the cul-de-sac. Uterus and adnexa appear normal. The bladder is normal. There is no adenopathy.  BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious-appearing sclerotic or lytic lesions."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with RLQ pain, nausea, and anorexia. The pain is worse with movement. Her temperature is normal. The physical exam reveals tenderness in the RLQ, but no rebound, guarding, or Rovsing's sign. The CBC and urine hCG are normal. The CT scan shows a normal appendix, a small amount of simple fluid near the cecal base, and trace fluid in the cul-de-sac.  The most likely diagnosis is early appendicitis.  While the appendix is not enlarged or significantly inflamed on CT, the presence of peri-appendiceal fluid and the patient's symptoms are concerning for early appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with RLQ pain, nausea, and anorexia. The pain is worse with movement.  Her temperature is normal. The physical exam reveals tenderness in the RLQ, but no rebound, guarding, or Rovsing's sign.  The CBC and urine hCG are normal. The CT scan shows a normal appendix, a small amount of simple fluid near the cecal base, and trace fluid in the cul-de-sac.  The most likely diagnosis is appendicitis, despite the normal appendix on CT.  Other possibilities include early appendicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or ovarian cyst.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
3. Ovarian Cyst
4. Cecal inflammation/irritation
5. Mesenteric adenitis

Treatment:  Given the high suspicion for appendicitis, a surgical consult is warranted.  If surgery is not immediately pursued, the patient should be observed closely with serial abdominal exams and repeat imaging if necessary.  IV fluids, pain medication, and antiemetics should be administered as needed.  If the diagnosis of appendicitis is confirmed, a laparoscopic appendectomy is the treatment of choice.  If pelvic inflammatory disease is suspected, antibiotic therapy should be initiated. If an ovarian cyst is suspected and causing significant pain, surgical intervention may be necessary.
