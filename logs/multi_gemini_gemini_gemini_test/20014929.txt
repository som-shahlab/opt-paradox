HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old female who underwent endoscopic ultrasound with  pancreatic biopsy by Dr. ___ yesterday morning,  presenting today with severe abdominal pain and nausea.  She  initially felt epigastric pain last evening after traveling to  her boyfriend's parent's home in ___.  She attributed  the pain to gas, ate toast, and went to bed.  This morning at  approximately 3 am, she had excruciating deep epigastric pain  and was unable to ambulate.  Her family called EMS and she was  transported to a local ED, where pancreatic enzymes were  elevated.  She was transferred to ___ for further evaluation  and treatement.  Review of symptoms negative in 12 system review other than those  stated above.   Past Medical History: 1. depression 2. orthostatic hypotension/tachycardia syndrome 3. ___ Disease 4. Sjogren's syndrome 5. malabsorption, with multiple endoscopy/colonoscopy in workup 6. anemia  7. pancreatic cystic lesion    Social History: ___ Family History: Positive for CAD, alcoholism, DM, bipolar, and autoimmune  diseases (mostly lupus).


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of severe abdominal pain and nausea following a recent endoscopic ultrasound with pancreatic biopsy raises concern for post-procedure complications, such as pancreatitis. The elevated pancreatic enzymes further support this possibility.  I need more information to assess the severity of her condition and rule out other potential causes.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's significantly elevated lipase and amylase, coupled with her severe epigastric pain and nausea following a recent pancreatic biopsy, strongly suggest post-procedure pancreatitis.  Her history of malabsorption and pancreatic cystic lesion may also be contributing factors. The CBC showing anemia is consistent with her history, and the low albumin may indicate malnutrition or inflammation. While we don't have lactate and blood culture results, the current findings are sufficient to support a diagnosis of pancreatitis.  I will now conclude the information gathering.

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: This patient presents with severe epigastric pain, nausea, and significantly elevated pancreatic enzymes (lipase and amylase) following an endoscopic ultrasound with pancreatic biopsy. This strongly suggests post-procedure pancreatitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Pancreatitis (post-ERCP)
2. Pancreatic Pseudocyst (potential complication)
3. Pancreatic Abscess (less likely given the acute presentation)
4. Perforation (less likely given the absence of free air and more prominent pancreatic findings)
5. Cholangitis (less likely given normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase)

Treatment:
* NIl per os (NPO) status: To allow the pancreas to rest.
* Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation:  To maintain hemodynamic stability and prevent complications.
* Pain management:  IV opioids (e.g., hydromorphone, fentanyl) for severe pain, transitioning to oral analgesics as tolerated.
* Antiemetics:  (e.g., ondansetron, promethazine) for nausea and vomiting.
* Close monitoring of vital signs, including oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure.
* Serial monitoring of pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase) and inflammatory markers (CRP, WBC).
* Abdominal imaging (CT scan with contrast) to assess for complications such as pseudocyst, necrosis, or abscess formation.
* Nutritional support:  If the patient remains NPO for an extended period, consider enteral nutrition via nasojejunal tube or parenteral nutrition.
* Consult gastroenterology for further management and endoscopic evaluation if necessary.
* Monitor for signs of infection and administer antibiotics if indicated.
* Address underlying anemia with iron supplementation if iron deficiency is confirmed.
