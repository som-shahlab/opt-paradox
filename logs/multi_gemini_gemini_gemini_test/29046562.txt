InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with melena, abdominal pain, anorexia, fevers, chills, and hematemesis, suggesting a gastrointestinal bleed (GIB). Given his history of CAD, PVD on Plavix and ASA, his risk is elevated.  The location of the bleed is unclear.  While he has a history of gastritis/esophagitis, the RLQ pain onset raises concern for a lower GIB source.  His history of adenomatous polyps also increases the risk of colorectal cancer. I need to assess his hemodynamic stability and determine the source and severity of the bleeding.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Although initial labs show normal Hgb/Hct, the patient has had melena for 3 days and hematemesis, indicating ongoing blood loss.  The elevated BUN/Creatinine suggests possible dehydration or acute kidney injury, likely secondary to the ongoing GIB.  I will order additional labs and imaging to further assess the bleeding and rule out other potential causes.  A type and screen is crucial in case transfusion is needed.  Troponin and lactic acid will help assess for any cardiac ischemia or other end-organ damage.  An abdominal CT scan will help visualize the abdomen to look for the source of the bleeding and other pathologies.  An EGD is also necessary given his history of gastritis/esophagitis and hematemesis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: I have repeatedly requested type and screen, troponin, and lactic acid, but the results are not available.  While having these results would be ideal, I cannot proceed without further evaluation of the patient's GIB.  The patient's clinical presentation with melena, hematemesis, and abdominal pain warrants immediate investigation.  I will now order imaging studies to identify the source of the bleeding.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast, EGD

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report from the available studies:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Acquisition sequence: 1) CT Localizer Radiograph 2) CT Localizer Radiograph   3) Stationary Acquisition 7.5 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 36.1 mGy (Body) DLP = 18.1 mGy-cm. 4) Spiral Acquisition 4.9 s, 53.0 cm; CTDIvol = 15.4 mGy (Body) DLP = 817.0 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 835 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Mild ___ nodularity in the left base suggests possible small airways disease. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion. Coronary artery calcifications are seen.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. Bilateral renal hypodensities are noted, some which are too small to fully characterize, some which worst consistent with cysts. There is no evidence of solid renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: Small hiatal hernia. The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon is noted, without evidence of wall thickening and fat stranding. The appendix is dilated, fluid-filled, and hyperemic, with mild surrounding fat stranding.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate and seminal vesicles are unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Extensive atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: A right inguinal hernia containing fat is noted.  The EGD is not available in the provided imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan reveals a dilated, fluid-filled, and hyperemic appendix with surrounding fat stranding, suggestive of appendicitis.  This finding, along with the patient's initial RLQ pain now migrating to periumbilical, fever, and anorexia, strongly points towards appendicitis as the cause of his symptoms. While the CT also shows diverticulosis, there are no signs of inflammation or perforation to suggest diverticulitis as the cause of the GIB.  The EGD result is still needed to definitively rule out an upper GI source of bleeding, although the lack of findings on CT makes an upper GI bleed less likely.
Action: imaging
Action Input: EGD

ToolMessage:
"The requested EGD (Esophagogastroduodenoscopy) is not available in the list of imaging studies. The only available imaging study is a CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Despite repeated requests, the EGD result is not available.  However, the patient's presentation and the CT findings strongly suggest appendicitis as the cause of his symptoms.  The initial RLQ pain migrating to periumbilical, fever, anorexia, and the CT findings of a dilated, fluid-filled, and hyperemic appendix with surrounding fat stranding are highly indicative of appendicitis. While an EGD would be ideal to definitively rule out an upper GI bleed, the absence of concerning findings on the abdominal CT makes an upper GI source less likely.  The patient's melena and hematemesis could be explained by swallowed blood from an inflamed appendix.  Given the strong clinical suspicion for appendicitis, I would proceed with surgical consultation for possible appendectomy.
