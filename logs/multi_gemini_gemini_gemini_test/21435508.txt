HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ female with history of IBS who presents with abdominal pain. Pain started ~6:30 this morning, ___, periumbilical with eventual migration to the RLQ, worsened with movement. She subsequently developed nausea and several episodes of emesis after attempting to eat breakfast. Patient reports that this pain is different from her IBS pain. Denies fevers, chills, dysuria, back pain. Currently, both nausea and pain has improved. Last meal was dinner the night previous. Patient has been attempting to get pregnant; last LMP in  ___.    Past Medical History: IBS    Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with abdominal pain migrating from periumbilical to RLQ, worsening with movement, associated with nausea and vomiting. This presentation is concerning for appendicitis.  Given the patient's desire to conceive, ectopic pregnancy and ovarian torsion must also be considered. To further assess, I need to know the patient's age, the details about her social history (specifically smoking, alcohol, and drug use), the date of her last menstrual period, and vital signs including temperature. A physical exam focusing on the abdomen is also necessary.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, obturator sign, psoas sign), pelvic exam

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and guarding raises concern for appendicitis.  Her age, desire to conceive, and last menstrual period are crucial to assess the likelihood of an ectopic pregnancy. While her temperature is normal now, it could have been elevated earlier. The lack of rebound tenderness lowers the suspicion for appendicitis but doesn't rule it out.  A urine pregnancy test is needed to rule out pregnancy, and a CBC and CMP would be helpful to assess for infection/inflammation and electrolyte imbalances due to vomiting.  An ultrasound would be helpful to visualize the appendix and rule out other pathologies like ovarian torsion or ectopic pregnancy.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: Urine pregnancy test, CBC, CMP

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's negative urine pregnancy test rules out ectopic pregnancy.  The elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia suggests an infectious or inflammatory process, further supporting the possibility of appendicitis.  To visualize the appendix and confirm the diagnosis, an abdominal ultrasound is necessary.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested abdominal ultrasound is not available among the provided imaging studies. The available studies are a pelvic/transvaginal ultrasound, an appendix ultrasound, and a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the unavailable abdominal ultrasound, the appendix ultrasound is the most appropriate imaging study to evaluate for appendicitis.  If the appendix ultrasound is non-diagnostic, a CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast can be considered for further evaluation. The pelvic/transvaginal ultrasound is less helpful for visualizing the appendix.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Appendix ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"US APPENDIX: TECHNIQUE: Grayscale ultrasound images of the pelvis were obtained with transabdominal approach followed by transvaginal approach for further delineation of uterine and ovarian anatomy.  FINDINGS: The uterus is anteverted and measures 7.8 x 3.1 x 4.8 cm. Uterus appears normal. The endometrium is homogenous and measures 7 mm. The ovaries are normal. Arterial and venous flow is demonstrated in both ovaries. There is a trace amount of free fluid, within physiologic range. Targeted ultrasound exam of the right lower quadrant was performed. The appendix was not visualized. No fluid collection or mass was seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and guarding.  Her vital signs are relatively normal, with a slightly elevated temperature.  The negative urine pregnancy test rules out ectopic pregnancy.  The elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia suggests an inflammatory process.  The appendix ultrasound did not visualize the appendix, which can happen in some cases of appendicitis.  Given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast is warranted to definitively rule out appendicitis and evaluate for other potential causes of her symptoms.
Action: done
Action Input: ""
