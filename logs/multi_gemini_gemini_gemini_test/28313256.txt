InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and subjective fevers and chills. While the CT scan shows a mildly enlarged appendix with some periappendiceal fat stranding, the findings are not definitive for acute appendicitis. Given the patient's symptoms and elevated white blood cell count, it's crucial to rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain, particularly those requiring urgent intervention.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign, Murphy's sign,  assess for rebound tenderness and guarding

ToolMessage:
"Admission  T97.1   HR 63  BP 108/65   RR 16   ___ 100 RA General: NAD CV: RRR Respiratory: Easy work of breathing Abdomen: Soft, nondistended, tender to palpation right lower quadrant Extremities: No edema"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's tenderness in the right lower quadrant, along with the initial presentation, persistent pain, and elevated white blood cell count, raises strong suspicion for appendicitis despite the non-definitive CT findings.  The physical exam findings support the possibility of appendicitis. Given the potential for rapid progression to perforation, I would proceed with a surgical consultation.
Action: done
Action Input: ""
