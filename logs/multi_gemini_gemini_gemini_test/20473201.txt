HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ history of hypothyroidism and celiac disease who presents with abdominal pain. Starting at 10pm last night, she reports onset of pain ___ that was sharp and non-radiating. This morning, the pain migrated to her RLQ with associated nausea and dry-heaving. Denies changes in bowel function, fevers, hematochezia/melena. No sick contacts. Last drank water at 5am.   Past Medical History: PMH:  hypothyroidism celiac disase (diagnosed age ___ HLD bilateral frozen shoulders s/p repair  PSH: b/l shoulder surgery for frozen shoulder R wrist surgery s/p trauma    Social History: ___ Family History: FH: Mother- colon cancer ___ at age ___, died at age ___.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with migrating abdominal pain that localized to the RLQ, nausea, and dry-heaving. Given the location of the pain, appendicitis is high on the differential. Other possibilities include ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy (if applicable), and complications related to celiac disease. I need more information to narrow down the diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign), pelvic exam (if female and of reproductive age)

ToolMessage:
"Admission exam: Vitals-98.3 63 113/67 16 100% RA  General- well-appearing, NAD HEENT- PERRL, EOMI, sclera anicteric, moist mucus membranes Cardiac- RRR Chest- CTAB Abdomen- soft, focally tender in RLQ mild LLQ tenderness and +Rovsing sign, nondistended. Positive obdurator sign, negative psoas sign. No rebound or guarding. No surgical scars.  Ext- WWP, no edema"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of migrating abdominal pain, now localized to the RLQ, along with nausea, dry-heaving, and a positive Rovsing's and obturator sign strongly suggests appendicitis.  The absence of fever doesn't rule it out, as early appendicitis may not present with fever. While other diagnoses are possible, the current findings point towards appendicitis as the most likely cause.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient is a female with a history of hypothyroidism and celiac disease presenting with migrating abdominal pain that started in the periumbilical region and localized to the RLQ. She also reports nausea and dry-heaving. Her physical exam reveals focal tenderness in the RLQ, a positive Rovsing's sign, and a positive obturator sign. These findings are highly suggestive of appendicitis.  While other diagnoses like ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy, or celiac disease exacerbation are possible, the clinical picture points strongly towards appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Ovarian cyst
3. Ectopic pregnancy (if of reproductive age, otherwise rule out)
4. Celiac disease exacerbation
5. Mesenteric adenitis

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for appendectomy.  Start IV fluids for hydration. Administer analgesics (e.g., morphine or fentanyl) for pain control.  Pre-operative antibiotics (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of metronidazole and ceftriaxone) should be administered.  If the patient is of reproductive age, a pregnancy test should be performed to rule out ectopic pregnancy. Continuous monitoring of vital signs and symptoms is essential. Post-operative care should include pain management, wound care, and monitoring for complications.
