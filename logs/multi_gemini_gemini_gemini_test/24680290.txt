No SOB    Past Medical History: 1. 3 vessel CAD. 2. MI x2(___, ___) 3. S/p LCX stent placement in ___ 4. Neg Stress test in ___ 5. CHF (EF=55%) 6. HTN 7. Hypercholesterolemia 8. DM2 ___ years 9. AF 10. Grave's 11. Right Carotid endarterectomy in 95 12. Polymyalgia 13. Bilateral Renal Stenosis (80%) 14. Chronic Anemia   Social History: ___ Family History: N/A


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right upper quadrant (RUQ) pain, nausea, and no fever or jaundice. Given the patient's history of CAD, MI, CHF, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM2, AF, Grave's disease, right carotid endarterectomy, polymyalgia, bilateral renal stenosis, and chronic anemia, the differential diagnosis includes biliary colic, cholecystitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, renal calculi, and myocardial ischemia.  I need to gather more information to narrow down the possibilities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show elevated WBCs, neutrophils, glucose, BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and INR.  The patient also has low RBCs, hemoglobin, and hematocrit.  The elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase) suggest liver injury. The elevated INR, along with the patient's history of being on anticoagulation therapy, raises concern for a possible coagulopathy. The elevated BUN and creatinine, along with a history of bilateral renal stenosis, suggest impaired kidney function. The elevated WBCs and neutrophils suggest a possible infection or inflammatory process. The RUQ pain could be related to the liver or biliary system.  The lack of fever and jaundice makes cholecystitis less likely.  Given the patient's complex medical history and the lab findings, I believe I have enough information to provide a differential diagnosis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**

1. **Discontinue any potentially hepatotoxic medications:** Review the patient's medication list and discontinue any drugs that could be contributing to liver injury.
