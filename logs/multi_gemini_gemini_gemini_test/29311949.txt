HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mrs. ___ is a ___ year-old female with history of biliary colic, known cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis s/p ERCP with stone/sludge extraction and sphincterotomy on ___ presenting with RUQ abdominal pain. The patient was otherwise in her normal state of health until 4 days ago when she experienced band-like pain across her upper abdomen after having a fatty meal. She states the pain went across her abdomen and down towards her lower quadrants and felt like 'reflux pain.' Alleviating factors included the dose of toradol she received in the ED, otherwise there were no other modifying factors. She has been tolerating non-fatty foods otherwise throughout the week. She denied any nausea or emesis, denied diarrhea, change in  stool either in quality or caliber, or changes to her urine. She  denied dysuria, flank pain or a history of renal stones. She noted subjective fevers for the past few days, no chills. She has a history of small bowel obstructions, treated conservatively, and notes passage of gas, but no bowel movement for 3 days.  On review of systems, she mentioned an exacerbation of her migraines, and is unsure whether this ___ have precipitated her abdominal pain.  Of note, the patient was scheduled for elective cholecystectomy with Dr. ___ in early ___. Her last colonoscopy was ___ years ago and was 'normal.'    Past Medical History: PMH: - Rectal cancer adenocarcinoma, stage I, s/p low anterior resection and anastamosis in ___, no chemo/rad     - SBO x 4 - managed conservatively    - found stricture at ~50cm on flex sig    - s/p head injury at age ___ -> "unsteady on feet ever since"   - Bilateral rotator cuff injuries and resulting pain since ___  - OSA  - Hypertension   - GERD   - Asthma   - Osteopenia   - Arthritis - Migraines   - Urinary retention since ___, s/p bladder sling surgery    s/p vaginal hysterectomy in ___    s/p left breast biopsy    PSH:  ___ - LAH (___) - bladder sling surgery   - vaginal hysterectomy in ___   - left breast biopsy         Social History: ___ Family History: Sister died of colon cancer. Paternal grandfather died of  gastric ca. Aunt, father both had multivascular dementia.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of biliary colic, cholelithiasis, choledocholithiasis, and current RUQ pain, it's crucial to assess for signs of biliary obstruction or other complications like cholangitis or pancreatitis.  The lack of bowel movement for 3 days also raises concern for possible obstruction, although she has a history of SBOs managed conservatively.  Her history of migraines and recent exacerbation warrants investigation to rule out any connection to her abdominal pain.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show a mild leukocytosis, which could indicate inflammation or infection.  The low red blood cell count and hematocrit suggest mild anemia, possibly related to chronic disease or other underlying causes.  Liver function tests and pancreatic enzymes are within normal limits, arguing against acute cholecystitis, cholangitis, or pancreatitis.  Urinalysis is also unremarkable.  Given her history of SBOs and current constipation, imaging is warranted to evaluate for bowel obstruction.  Additionally, given her history of cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis, imaging of the biliary tree is needed to assess for potential obstruction or other complications.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast, RUQ ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"From the requested imaging studies, I can provide the RUQ/LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US report:  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN)  FINDINGS: The liver is normal in echotexture without focal lesion, intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The gallbladder is distended, with gallstones and sludge. The gallbladder wall is thickened, slightly hyperemic with a positive sonographic ___ sign. The imaged IVC is unremarkable. The imaged pancreas is normal, but the distal body and tail are not well seen due to overlying bowel gas. The aorta is not well seen due to bowel gas. No free fluid is seen.  The CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast is not available in the provided imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The RUQ ultrasound confirms the presence of gallstones and sludge, a thickened gallbladder wall, and a positive sonographic Murphy's sign, all highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis.  While the distal pancreas was not well visualized, the available view showed no abnormalities.  The lack of biliary ductal dilatation argues against choledocholithiasis as the primary cause of her current symptoms.  Although the CT abdomen/pelvis was not available, the ultrasound findings combined with the patient's history and lab results provide sufficient information for a clinical diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.  The patient's history of SBOs and current constipation warrant close monitoring, but her overall clinical picture points towards acute cholecystitis as the primary issue.

Treatment:  Given the ultrasound findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis, the patient should be admitted for intravenous fluids, pain management, and nil per os (NPO) status.  A surgical consultation should be obtained for consideration of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be initiated to cover for potential infection.
