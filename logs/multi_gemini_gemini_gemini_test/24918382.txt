InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute onset nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea after eating fast food three days prior.  The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain worsening in the LLQ and absence of flatus raise concern for possible complications like intestinal obstruction or perforation.  Given the patient's history of minimal PO intake and lightheadedness with ambulation, assessing hydration status and electrolyte levels is crucial.  Further evaluation is needed to determine the cause of her gastrointestinal symptoms and rule out serious conditions.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count, along with low sodium and chloride, suggesting dehydration and a possible infectious process.  The normal lipase makes pancreatitis less likely.  The lack of stool studies hinders assessing for infectious causes of gastroenteritis.  Abdominal imaging is necessary to evaluate for potential complications like intestinal obstruction or other anatomical abnormalities given the patient's worsening abdominal pain, lack of flatus, and elevated WBC.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"There are three CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast studies available in the list. I'll provide the most recent one:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  EXAMINATION: CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 624 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: There are new bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left with adjacent compressive atelectasis. There is trace pericardial effusion. Coronary artery calcifications are again noted.  ABDOMEN:  HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: A 2.5 cm indeterminate left adrenal nodule is unchanged. The right adrenal gland is unremarkable.  URINARY: There has been an interval improvement in the appearance of the bilateral renal cortices, with faint remaining wedge-shaped hypodensities bilaterally likely reflecting improving bilateral pyelonephritis. There is no evidence of hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Again seen are numerous dilated, loop fluid-filled small bowel loops measuring up to 4.5 cm with a transition point in the mid pelvis, similar in appearance to the prior study (32:52). Air and fluid is present in the colon, which suggests that this is an ileus or partial small bowel obstruction. There are tiny locules of free air in the anterior abdomen, which may be related to the drainage procedure or micro perforation diverticular abscesses. There is significant mesenteric edema. A left lower quadrant pigtail catheter is coiled in the site of the previously seen air in fluid collection adjacent to sigmoid colon, which has been decompressed (302:53). Additional fluid collections are now present in the pelvis, for example a collection measuring 2.1 x 2.1 cm (302:58), and a tubular, peripherally enhancing fluid collection in the left hemipelvis measuring up to 3.7 cm in maximum dimension (601:44). There may be additional small fluid collections that are indistinguishable from small bowel in the pelvis.  PELVIS: Air is present within the bladder. Please correlate with recent catheterization or instrumentation. The differential diagnosis would include colovesical fistula. There is moderate volume free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: A pessary is in place. The patient is status post hysterectomy. No adnexal mass is identified.  LYMPH NODES: Mesenteric lymph nodes are not well seen due to mesenteric edema. Prominent retroperitoneal lymph nodes are probably reactive. There is no inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Extensive atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: Chronic fracture deformity of the left superior pubic ramus is unchanged. Levoscoliosis of the lower lumbar spine with associated degenerative changes are unchanged. There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: There is diffuse anasarca.  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with ACS ___ resident, M.D. by ___ ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 5:31 pm, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan reveals small bowel obstruction with a transition point in the mid-pelvis, free air in the abdomen suggesting microperforation, and new fluid collections in the pelvis.  These findings, combined with the patient's worsening abdominal pain, elevated WBC, and electrolyte abnormalities, point towards a serious intra-abdominal pathology requiring surgical intervention.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Small bowel obstruction with microperforation
2. Pelvic abscess
3. Gastroenteritis with dehydration
4. Diverticulitis with microperforation
5. Pyelonephritis (improving)

Treatment: The patient requires admission for bowel rest, IV fluids with electrolyte correction (specifically sodium and chloride), and broad-spectrum antibiotics covering both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.  Serial abdominal exams and repeat CT scans are necessary to monitor for worsening obstruction or peritonitis.  Surgical consultation is warranted to evaluate the need for exploratory laparotomy if the patient's condition deteriorates or fails to improve with conservative management.

The gynecology team should be consulted to evaluate the pelvic fluid collections and rule out a gynecological source of infection.
