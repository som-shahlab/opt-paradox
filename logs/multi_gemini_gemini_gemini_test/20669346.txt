Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Patirent presentsed with 1 day history of abdominal pain R>L and  nausea beginning ___. Pt. stated her abdominal pain  remained until the following day at which point she decided to  go to urgent care. Labs were drawn which noted an elevated WBC  and pt. was transferred to ___ ED for further imaging. RUQ ultrasound  characterized a distended gallbladder, cholelithiasis,  pericholecystic fluid with + sonographic ___ sign. On  presentation, pt. was in no acute distress and complaining of  continued abdominal pain. She endorsed mild chills and x 1 BM,  however no fevers, emesis, diarrhea, prior abdominal surgeries, chest pain, or SOB.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right-sided abdominal pain, nausea, elevated WBC, and an ultrasound showing a distended gallbladder, cholelithiasis, and pericholecystic fluid. This suggests a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.  However, to solidify the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of abdominal pain, I need more information about the onset, character, and radiation of the pain, as well as any associated symptoms. Additionally, I need to know the patient's vital signs and the results of the initial labs.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Murphy's sign, assessment of abdominal tenderness and rebound tenderness, auscultation of bowel sounds, vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation)

ToolMessage:
"Vitals Signs stable Gen: NAD, comfortable in the bed, A&O x3,  HEENT: NCAT, no scleral icterus, PERRL,  Pulm: no increased work of breathing, clear breath sounds  present bilat,  Abd: Soft, non-distended, incisions c/d/i, mild TTP diffusely,  EXT: warm, well perfused, sensory and motor intact,"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right-sided abdominal pain, nausea, elevated WBC, and an ultrasound showing a distended gallbladder, cholelithiasis, and pericholecystic fluid, concerning for acute cholecystitis. The physical exam reveals mild diffuse tenderness but no rebound or guarding.  While Murphy's sign was not explicitly mentioned in the physical exam findings, the ultrasound findings combined with the patient's symptoms and elevated WBC strongly suggest acute cholecystitis.  No other concerning findings were noted on physical exam. I will proceed with a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Cholecystitis
2. Choledocholithiasis
3. Biliary colic
4. Pancreatitis
5. Appendicitis

Treatment:
* **NPO:**  To reduce gallbladder stimulation.
* **IV Fluids:** For hydration and electrolyte balance.
* **Analgesia:**  IV opioids (e.g., morphine, hydromorphone) or NSAIDs (e.g., ketorolac) for pain management.
* **Antibiotics:**  IV antibiotics covering gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., ceftriaxone and metronidazole) are recommended for acute cholecystitis.
* **Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy:** This is the definitive treatment for acute cholecystitis and should be performed ideally within 24-72 hours of admission, if the patient is clinically stable.  Early laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been shown to reduce hospital stay, complications, and overall costs.
* **Post-operative Care:**  Monitor for complications such as bleeding, infection, bile leak.  Provide pain management and early ambulation.  Diet can be advanced as tolerated.
* **Consult Surgery:** Early surgical consultation is crucial for timely intervention.
