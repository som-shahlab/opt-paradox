HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with Hx significant for lung ca, bladder ca, A fib on  coumadin presents with right-sided abdominal pain x2 days.  This  pain started after eating, subsided but did not resolve, and  recurred throughout the day.  He had a bowel movement during  this period, but denied nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena,  BRBPR.  No change in urinary habits.  No chest pain, dyspnea,  fevers, chills, or other pain.  No previous episodes of similar  pain.   . He presented to an OSH for evaluation.  Labs there revealed a  likely obstructive picture with leukocytosis (13.5).  RUQ  ultrasound revealed cholelithiasis.  He was given Unasyn and  transferred to this facility per patient request. . In the ED, initial vs were:  97.6 63 130/60 16 98% RA. Patient was given 1L NS and unasyn.  Surgery was consulted who  recommended admission to medicine for ERCP and elective  cholecystectomy in the future. .   On the floor, he complained of mild abdominal pain. He denied  fever, chills, chest pain, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,  melena, BRBPR.  Last BM yesterday, has passed flatus while in  the ED.   Past Medical History: s/p appendectomy (distant) bladder cancer lung cancer:  RLL adenocarcinoma s/p VATS wedge (___) s/p TURP atrial fibrillation on coumadin stage III CKD (etiology unknown, possibly chemo or contrast)   Social History: ___ Family History: CAD in both parents


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right-sided abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and cholelithiasis on ultrasound, suggestive of acute cholecystitis. Given his history of A fib on coumadin, it's crucial to assess his coagulation status before any invasive procedures like ERCP. Additionally, his history of lung and bladder cancer raises the possibility of metastatic disease, which could be contributing to his abdominal pain.  A physical exam will help assess the current abdominal pain and look for any signs of complications.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show elevated INR, likely due to his coumadin therapy.  His elevated bilirubin, ALP, ALT, and AST suggest biliary obstruction or hepatocellular injury. While the lipase is normal, the significantly elevated liver enzymes and clinical picture still point towards biliary pathology. The elevated BUN and creatinine indicate impaired renal function, consistent with his history of CKD.  His leukocytosis has improved compared to the outside hospital. I have enough information to make a recommendation.
