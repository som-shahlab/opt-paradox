HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ year old obese man, with DM Type 2 who  began having abdominal pain in his RUQ on ___ while  at work. The pain worsened over the next two days and was not  alleviated by Percocet, which patient had PRN for leg pain. The  patient rated the pain as ___ through ___ and ___ and  began experiencing nausea. He denies diarrhea, vomiting, fever and chills. He presented to OSH on ___, and had  CT scan and ultrasound. He was transfered to ___ ___ night  and was hypotensive on arrival to ___ requiring 3L of IVF. On  arrival his pain is ___ and still has nausea. Of note, patient  has an incarcerated umbilical hernia which he states has been  present for many years and is unchanged.   Past Medical History: Past Medical History: - Two cardiac stents placed ___ years ago - Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus dx ___ - Peripheral neuropathy - Hypertension - Hyperlipidemia   Past Surgical History: - Gastric bypass ___ - Umbilical hernia repair ___ years ago complicated by mesh infection requiring removal resulting in subsequent recurrence - Left eye cataract surgery    Social History: ___ Family History: Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and hypotension, which could indicate several conditions like cholecystitis, cholangitis, pancreatitis, or even a perforated viscus. Given his history of obesity, diabetes, and prior abdominal surgeries (gastric bypass and umbilical hernia repair), the risk of gallstones and other complications is higher.  The prior imaging at the outside hospital (OSH) could be helpful. To proceed, I need to review those images and also obtain some lab tests to assess organ function and look for signs of infection or inflammation.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RUQ pain, nausea, and hypotension raises concern for several diagnoses, including cholecystitis, cholangitis, and pancreatitis. The lab results show an elevated white blood cell count, indicating an inflammatory process.  The elevated creatinine and BUN suggest some degree of renal impairment, which could be acute or chronic, and may be related to dehydration from his symptoms.  The elevated INR is also notable and needs further investigation. Lipase and amylase are within normal limits, making pancreatitis less likely.  I now need to review the outside imaging studies (CT and ultrasound) to further narrow the differential diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis, Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant

ToolMessage:
"From the requested imaging studies, I can find the Ultrasound of the right upper quadrant (LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US) in the available list. However, the report only shows the study name without the full findings. The complete report details are not provided in the available text.  The CT abdomen and pelvis is not available in the list of available imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's elevated WBC count suggests an inflammatory or infectious process. The normal lipase and amylase make pancreatitis less likely.  The elevated creatinine and BUN suggest renal impairment, possibly due to dehydration. The elevated INR could be due to underlying liver disease or a medication effect. The lack of full imaging reports limits my ability to pinpoint the diagnosis.  While the ultrasound was mentioned, the lack of findings makes it unhelpful.  Since I don't have access to the prior CT and a repeat CT isn't available, I will proceed with the most likely diagnosis based on the available information, which is cholecystitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

Consult surgery for evaluation and likely cholecystectomy.  Further investigate the elevated INR with a thorough medication review and consider checking for vitamin K deficiency.
