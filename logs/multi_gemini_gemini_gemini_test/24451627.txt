HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms ___ is a ___ with past medical history significant for  hypertension, morbid obesity presenting with left lower quadrant  pain after lunch. She describes the pain as sharp and  persistent, initially associated with nausea/vomiting x1 day.  Denies fever, chills, nausea, vomiting. She has since has very  poor appetite. She has been passing gas and having small bowel  movements. She was hospitalized for 4 days in ___ for her ___  episode of diveriticulitis which was managed conservatively with  antibiotics. Most recent colonscopy was in ___ which was  significant for sigmoid diverticulosis. Because of her  persistent abdominal pain, she presented to the ED for further  evaluation.    Past Medical History: excision of a pilonidal x ___ years infected mons pubis HTN Asthma-triggered by allergies Bronchitis allergic rhinitis CRPS R arm ___ Obesity  PSH:  C-section x 3 Laparoscopy ___ cyst drainage ___ cholecystectomy  pilonidal ___   Social History: ___ Family History: No GI disease.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with left lower quadrant pain, which could be consistent with diverticulitis given her history. However, other diagnoses such as ovarian cysts, irritable bowel syndrome, or even a hernia need to be considered.  I need more information to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, guarding, rebound, and masses), pelvic exam

ToolMessage:
"Admission  Vitals: 98.0  92  138/68  22  98%RA GEN: AOx3, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, RLQ tenderness to palpation, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of diverticulitis and presents with LLQ pain, making recurrent diverticulitis a strong possibility. The physical exam shows tenderness in the RLQ, not the LLQ, which is unexpected. While the RLQ tenderness could be referred pain, it requires further investigation.  The patient also has a history of ovarian cysts, which could be another cause of abdominal pain.  Given the RLQ tenderness, appendicitis, although less likely given the lack of fever, nausea, and vomiting, should also be considered. Imaging is necessary to differentiate between these possibilities and evaluate for other potential causes.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report from the available imaging studies. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: Abdomen and pelvic CT.  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE:  Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 5.5 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 26.5 mGy (Body) DLP = 13.2 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 4.9 s, 53.5 cm; CTDIvol = 16.9 mGy (Body) DLP = 902.7 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 916 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is moderate and intra and extrahepatic biliary dilation, somewhat increased from prior exam. The common bile duct measures up to 12 mm, more pronounced than on the prior study. The common bile duct tapers distally, without gross filling defect or obstructing lesions seen. The gallbladder is not visualized.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. There is bowel wall thickening, with associated pericolonic stranding involving the sigmoid colon in a region of diverticula, most likely compatible with acute ____. Along the lateral aspect of the sigmoid wall, there is a small, 1.2 cm hypodense fluid collection concerning for a small abscess. There is no extraluminal air. The appendix is normal.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus is of normal size and enhancement. There is no evidence of adnexal abnormality bilaterally.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: There is a superficial 2.4 cm focus of soft tissue nodularity with surrounding fat stranding along the right anterior abdominal wall with associated skin thickening.  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with Dr. ___. by ___ ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 9:57 ___, 10 minutes after discovery of the findings."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's history, physical exam, and CT scan findings point towards a diagnosis of acute diverticulitis with a small abscess. The CT confirms bowel wall thickening and pericolonic stranding in the sigmoid colon, consistent with her history of diverticulosis and previous episodes of diverticulitis.  The presence of a small hypodense fluid collection raises concern for a small abscess. The RLQ tenderness noted on physical exam could be referred pain from the sigmoid diverticulitis.  While the biliary dilation is noted, it is not the primary cause of her current symptoms. The superficial soft tissue nodularity is likely unrelated to her abdominal pain.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**

2. Irritable Bowel Syndrome

She should be kept NPO initially, then advanced to a clear liquid diet as tolerated.  Pain control should be managed with IV opioids initially, transitioning to oral analgesics as she improves.

Follow-up imaging of the biliary tree should be considered in the outpatient setting to evaluate the progression of the biliary dilation.
