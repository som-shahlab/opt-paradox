HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ is a ___ year old male who presents with 2 days of RLQ pain and mild nausea. The pain was initially diffuse but then migrated to his RLQ yesterday and became more severe.   He has had some nausea during this time but not vomiting, no loose stools, has been slightly constipated.   ROS: a 12 point pertinent review of systems was completed and negative unless stated above.     Past Medical History: PMHx: none  PSHx: none    Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, and constipation raises suspicion for appendicitis.  Migrating pain from periumbilical to RLQ is a classic symptom.  However, other diagnoses like mesenteric adenitis, gastroenteritis, or even a kidney stone need to be considered. I need to gather more information through physical exam and lab tests before I can provide a more confident assessment.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on McBurney's point tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure

ToolMessage:
"ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION Temp: 98.8 HR: 91 BP: 134/54 Resp: 16 O(2)Sat: 97 Normal Constitutional: NAD HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic, Pupils equal, round and reactive to light Oropharynx within normal limits Chest: Clear to auscultation Cardiovascular: Regular Rate and Rhythm, Normal first and second heart sounds Abdominal: RLQ tenderness Extr/Back: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema Skin: No rash, Warm and dry Neuro: Speech fluent Psych: Normal mood, Normal mentation"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The physical exam findings of RLQ tenderness further increase the suspicion for appendicitis.  The absence of fever argues against it somewhat, but it's not definitive.  Lab tests are needed to assess for signs of infection and inflammation, and to help differentiate between appendicitis and other possible diagnoses.
Action: laboratory tests

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, nausea, and constipation. Physical exam reveals RLQ tenderness.  Lab results are largely unremarkable, though a slightly elevated total bilirubin is noted. While the WBC count is normal, it can be normal in early appendicitis. Given the constellation of findings, appendicitis remains the most likely diagnosis.  Imaging is needed to confirm.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Single phase contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 274 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: Evaluation is suboptimal due to the paucity of intra-abdominal fat. Given this:  HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: There is substantial right lower quadrant fat stranding with a traversing dilated hyperemic, thickened fluid-filled tubular structure which measures up to 14 mm and which likely represents the appendix (602:38, 02:49). Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate and seminal vesicles are grossly unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits.  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with ___, M.D. by ___ ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 8:36 pm, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and now the CT scan confirming a dilated, hyperemic, and thickened appendix strongly support the diagnosis of appendicitis.  The fat stranding also corroborates this.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, nausea, and constipation, along with RLQ tenderness on physical exam, initially raised suspicion for appendicitis.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, showing a dilated, hyperemic, thickened, fluid-filled appendix with surrounding fat stranding.  These findings are highly suggestive of acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric adenitis
3. Gastroenteritis
4. Kidney stone
5. Constipation

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy. This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the severity of the inflammation and surgeon preference.  Pre-operatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem, or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole).  Post-operatively, the patient should receive pain control, continue antibiotics as indicated, and be monitored for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  The patient should be educated on wound care and follow-up appointments.
