HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is an ___ y/o male with a PMH notable for prostate  cancer s/p transabdominal radical prostatectomy, who presented  to the ___ ED with three days of acute lower abdominal pain.  He describes it as a sharp ___ pain that is constant and does  not radiate. He has not tried any pain medications. Since the  pain started, he has had decreased appetite and has not had a  bowel movement. He does report passing gas, although less than  usual. At baseline, he has daily bowel movements. He also  reports a fever of 101.0 two days prior to presentation. He  denies any further episodes of fevers, nausea, vomiting, and  diarrhea.   His most recent colonoscopy was in ___, which showed evidence  of diverticulosis with recommended five-year follow-up.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: Prostate cancer, s/p radical prostatectomy  Bladder cancer, s/p TURBT  Anxiety  Asbestosis - cough with white phlegm  HTN  HLD  Diabetes   Past Surgical History: Transurethral resection of bladder tumor, ___ Excision of right breast mass, ___  Radical prostatectomy and pelvic LN dissection, ___  Excision of venous angioma of lower lip, ___  Bilateral cataract surgery, per patient    Social History: ___ Family History: Mother died at ___ from brain hemorrhage, diabetes. Father also  diabetic, died from MI age ___. One brother ___ w/diabetes.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with acute lower abdominal pain, decreased appetite, constipation, and fever raises concerns for several possible diagnoses, including diverticulitis given his history of diverticulosis.  Other possibilities include a small bowel obstruction or other infectious or inflammatory processes. To narrow down the differential, I need more information about his current symptoms, vital signs, and abdominal exam findings.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation; noting tenderness, guarding, rebound, distension, masses), rectal exam

ToolMessage:
"Admission   Vitals: Temp: 97.9 HR: 83 BP: 122/72 RR:18 O2: 98% RA  GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, EOMI CV: RRR PULM: CTAB ABD: Soft, non-distended, tender to palpation in lower abdomen, +rebound tenderness in LLQ, +guarding LLQ, +bowel sounds, well healed lower midline surgical scar visible Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with lower abdominal pain, fever, decreased appetite, constipation, and rebound tenderness in the LLQ is highly suggestive of acute diverticulitis.  The absence of distension argues against a bowel obstruction. Given the patient's history of diverticulosis and the current findings, I would want to confirm the diagnosis with imaging.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report from the available studies:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen pelvis with intravenous contrast  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP 366.7 mGy  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion. There is redemonstration of a calcified pleural plaque along the left hemidiaphragm, indicative of prior asbestos exposure (series 5, image 17).  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. Diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon is noted, with evidence of wall thickening and fat stranding consistent with ____. Along the superior wall of the sigmoid colon in the region of ____ is a rim enhancing fluid collection compatible with an abscess that measures 1.2 x 0.9 x 1.3 cm. No evidence of drainable fluid collection or free intraperitoneal air. The appendix is normal.  PELVIS: There are multiple surgical clips in the pelvis compatible with prior prostatectomy. The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The patient is status post radical prostatectomy.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Moderate atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. Mild anterior loss of height of the T11 and T12 vertebral bodies appear unchanged.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute sigmoid diverticulitis with a small abscess.  The patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with uncomplicated diverticulitis, which can typically be managed conservatively with antibiotics and bowel rest.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis with a small abscess.  The patient's presentation and CT findings warrant inpatient admission for intravenous antibiotics and supportive care.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Diverticulitis with abscess
2. Small Bowel Obstruction
