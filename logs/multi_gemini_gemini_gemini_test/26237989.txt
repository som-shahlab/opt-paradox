HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with history of diverticulitis presents with RLQ and LLQ abdominal pain. Patient had his first episode of diverticulitis  ___ years ago which required hospitalization and IV antibiotics. His second episode of diverticulitis was a year ago and he responded well to outpatient therapy. His current episode of abdominal  pain began in the LLQ, 5 days ago. He reports that the pain was similar in location and quality to his prior diverticulitis. He was seen by his PCP 3 days ago with recommendations for outpatient treatment, however his pain began to improve. Today  at around 11 am, patient began to have general abdominal pain that localized to the RLQ over the course of the day. This pain was much more severe than his diverticulitis pain and has persisted. He denies nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and malaise.   ROS: Denies nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, and malaise. Denies sore throat, constipation, diarrhea, and weight loss.    Past Medical History:  Diverticulitis, colon polyps, DJD   PSH: R ECRB release on ___ & ___      Family History: Noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of diverticulitis with LLQ pain similar to previous episodes. However, the new RLQ pain of greater severity raises concern for other diagnoses, such as appendicitis.  I need to gather more information to differentiate between these possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness in LLQ and RLQ, McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign, rectal exam, vital signs including temperature

ToolMessage:
"Upon presentation to ___: VS: 97.2 67 141/95 20 99%  Gen: Appears well, NAD CV: RRR Resp: CTAB Abd: Mildly distended, tender maximally in RLQ with voluntary guarding. Tender in LLQ without rebound or guarding. No scars on abdomen. Ext: Warm, no edema"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain that is more severe than his previous diverticulitis pain, along with LLQ tenderness.  The physical exam shows maximal tenderness in the RLQ with voluntary guarding, and tenderness in the LLQ without rebound or guarding.  While the patient's history and LLQ tenderness suggest possible diverticulitis, the severe RLQ pain with guarding raises concern for appendicitis.  A CT scan is necessary to differentiate between these and other possible diagnoses.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained after uneventful administration of IV contrast. Axial, coronal and sagittal reformats were reviewed.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Imaged lung bases are clear. The liver, spleen, bilateral kidneys, bilateral adrenal glands, and pancreas appear unremarkable. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically. There is no lymphadenopathy. The stomach, duodenum and small intestine appear unremarkable.  CT OF THE PELVIS: The bladder and prostate are unremarkable. There is mild fat stranding (2:74) surrounding a diverticulum along the proximal sigmoid colon. There is no evidence of perforation. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy by CT criteria. The appendix is dilated up to 1.1 cm with mild periappendiceal fat stranding. There is an appendicolith at the base of the appendix. There is no evidence of perforation.  BONE WINDOWS: No concerning lesions are seen for malignancy or infection. Degenerative changes in the hips and spine again seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's history, physical exam, and CT findings point to acute appendicitis.  The CT report confirms a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding and an appendicolith, classic findings for appendicitis. While the CT also shows mild fat stranding around a sigmoid colon diverticulum, the severity of the RLQ pain and the CT findings for appendicitis make it the primary diagnosis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's history of diverticulitis with LLQ pain, along with the new, more severe RLQ pain, initially suggested both diverticulitis and appendicitis as possible diagnoses. The CT scan confirms the presence of diverticulitis with mild fat stranding around a diverticulum in the sigmoid colon.  Crucially, the CT also reveals a dilated appendix with periappendiceal fat stranding and an appendicolith, strongly indicating appendicitis.  The appendicolith is a key finding, as it is often associated with appendicitis.  While the patient lacks some typical symptoms like fever, nausea, and vomiting, the imaging findings combined with the localized RLQ pain and guarding point towards appendicitis as the primary diagnosis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Diverticulitis
3. Epiploic appendagitis
4. Typhlitis
5. Mesenteric adenitis

Treatment:  Given the CT findings suggestive of acute appendicitis, the recommended treatment is appendectomy. This can be performed laparoscopically, which is generally preferred for its minimally invasive nature and faster recovery time.  The patient should be started on IV fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, such as a combination of cefoxitin or cefotetan (or ertapenem for penicillin allergy) and metronidazole.  Pain management should be provided with opioid analgesics as needed.  Post-operatively, the patient should be monitored for complications such as infection, bleeding, or abscess formation.  The patient should also be advised to follow a clear liquid diet initially and gradually advance to a regular diet as tolerated.  The patient should follow up with their surgeon for wound care and further management.  The diverticulitis appears mild and can be managed conservatively after the appendectomy, with a high-fiber diet and increased fluid intake recommended for long-term management.
