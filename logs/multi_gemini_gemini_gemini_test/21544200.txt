HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:

He reports subjective fevers, nausea and malaise, but denies chills, emesis, chest pain, shortness of breath, difficulty voiding or changes in bowel movements. He has never had pain like this before. In the ED, a CT scan was  notable for an inflamed appendix with local fat stranding, non-perforated. Lab work notable for a WBC of 11.2.     Past Medical History: PMH:  Eczema ADD  PSH: None   Social History: ___ Family History: None.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute RLQ abdominal pain, fever, nausea, and malaise. The CT scan shows an inflamed appendix with local fat stranding, and the elevated WBC count further supports the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  While the CT scan indicates the appendix is not perforated, it's important to assess the patient's current clinical status to determine the severity of the inflammation and the need for immediate surgical intervention.  A physical exam will help evaluate for peritoneal signs and assess the patient's overall condition.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity in RLQ; assessment of vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure;  evaluation of hydration status.

ToolMessage:
"Admission   VS: Afebrile, AVSS Gen: NAD, A&Ox3, pleasant, conversant CV: RRR Resp: Breathing comfortably on room air Abd: Soft, tender in the RLQ, no rebound or guarding Ext: Warm, well-perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute RLQ abdominal pain concerning for acute appendicitis.  The CT scan showed an inflamed, non-perforated appendix with local fat stranding, and lab work showed an elevated WBC count.  The physical exam reveals localized tenderness in the RLQ without rebound or guarding, suggesting uncomplicated acute appendicitis.  The patient is afebrile and vital signs are within normal limits, indicating stable condition.  Given the clinical picture and imaging findings, the patient has uncomplicated acute appendicitis and should be treated accordingly.
Action: done
Action Input: ""
