HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This is a ___ with no significant PMH who presents with 5 days  of epigastric abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. She reports  she has ongoing pain and has had a number of episodes of nausea  and vomiting. She denies fevers or chills. Has had previous  episodes like this but has not seen a doctor ___ it. ___ reports  since her ERCP her pain has resolved.  She is currently very  sleepy.    Past Medical History: Seasonal Allergies S/P C-section x2    Social History: ___ Family History: Father with diabetes, Aunt with heart disease


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting for 5 days. This could indicate a number of gastrointestinal issues, such as gastritis, pancreatitis, gallstones, or even a bowel obstruction.  The fact that she's had similar episodes before but hasn't sought medical attention, along with the mention of an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) suggests a possible history of biliary or pancreatic issues. The ERCP likely resolved the current episode, but understanding the underlying cause is crucial for long-term management.  I need more information about the patient's vital signs, the character of the pain, and some lab tests to narrow down the possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, palpation, percussion), assessment of hydration status

"98.4 BP: 152/82 HR: 85 R: 16 O2: 99%RA well appearing female laying in bed in NAD. Sleepy but easily arousable. HEENT: MMM, no scleral icterus Lungs: Clear B/L on auscultation ___: RRR S1 S2 present Abdomen: Distended, non-tender, no rebound or guarding Ext: No edema Neuro: Moving all extremities AAOx3  Exam"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's vital signs are stable, and the physical exam reveals a distended but non-tender abdomen with no rebound or guarding. This makes serious conditions like peritonitis or appendicitis less likely.  The absence of scleral icterus argues against severe biliary obstruction. However, the history of recurrent episodes similar to this one, combined with the recent ERCP, still points towards a potential issue within the biliary or pancreatic system.  The resolution of symptoms after the ERCP strongly suggests that the procedure addressed the acute problem, likely a blockage.  Given the patient's sleepiness and history, I believe I have enough information to provide a differential diagnosis and suggest a plan.
