Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
HPI: Ms. ___ is a ___ year old female with history of HTN, adult acne who presented to the ED with RUQ pain.  THe patient about 2 months ago and earlier this month had been feeling intermittent sensations of epigastric burning, nonradiating, thought to be from what she thought was heartburn. She was taking ranitidine for this. She felt it was heartburn especially because her parents unfortunately passed away that time as well and was experiencing a lot of stress.  She saw her PCP, ___ discovered abnormal LFTs and RUQ US was done on ___ that showed cholelithiasis.  However, yesterday evening she ate a quiche at about 6PM, then  at 8PM she noticed new acute onset of RUQ pain, different in characteristic from the previously thought heartburn sensation. She took Pepcid which did not help. She had associated nausea, but no vomiting. No fever, cough, SOB, diarrhea. Her last bowel movement was normal yesterday. At time of this interview she  does not have any pain at rest, but does feel some  She does not have a history of any prior abdominal or major surgery including C sections.  ED: Found to have lipase ___ and Tbili 1.6, Dbili 1.1, AST  547, AST 518, ALP 165. Abdominal US was done showing cholelithiasis without findings of acute cholecystitis.

Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain and significantly elevated liver enzymes, concerning for biliary pathology. While she has a history of cholelithiasis and her initial ultrasound did not show cholecystitis, her worsening pain and LFTs suggest a possible evolving picture. I need to gather more information to determine the cause of her current symptoms and rule out other potential diagnoses.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show significantly elevated lipase, confirming pancreatitis.  The elevated bilirubin and liver enzymes, along with the history of cholelithiasis and RUQ pain, suggest that gallstones are the likely cause of the pancreatitis.  The absence of findings suggestive of acute cholecystitis on the ultrasound does not rule out gallstone pancreatitis. Given the patient's clinical picture and lab results, I have enough information to recommend a diagnosis and treatment plan.
