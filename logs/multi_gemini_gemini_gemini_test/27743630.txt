HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___. female p/w epigastric pain since last night with  radiation to RLQ.  Reports nausea, profuse vomiting, and  diarrhea last night, unable to keep down fluids.  Reports  anorexia.  Denies fever and chills.   Past Medical History: Sarcoidosis diagnosed in ___, positive PPD, osteoarthritis, benign positional vertigo, and glucose intolerance.  Past Surgical History: None.   Social History: ___ Family History: Arthritis.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric pain radiating to the right lower quadrant, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia. These symptoms could indicate a range of gastrointestinal issues, including appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, gastritis, or gastroenteritis.  Given the patient's history of sarcoidosis, it's also important to consider potential extraintestinal manifestations of this disease.  I need more information to narrow down the differential diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results are largely normal, except for slightly elevated glucose in both serum and urine.  The normal lipase makes pancreatitis less likely. While the WBC is normal, the patient's symptoms of epigastric pain radiating to the RLQ, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea still raise concern for appendicitis or cholecystitis.  An abdominal ultrasound would help visualize these organs.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested abdominal ultrasound is not available among the provided imaging studies. The available studies are only a CT abdomen with contrast and a chest X-ray (PA & lateral views)."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the unavailable abdominal ultrasound, the CT abdomen with contrast will be helpful to evaluate for appendicitis, cholecystitis, or other abdominal pathology.  The chest x-ray can be used to assess for any pulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis, although the patient's current symptoms are primarily gastrointestinal.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen with contrast

ToolMessage:
"CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired contiguous axial images from the lung bases to pubic symphysis were obtained following the administration of 130 cc of IV Optiray. Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were performed.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear. Liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, ureters, stomach, and loops of small and large bowel are within normal limits. Abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. No free air or free fluid is seen. There is no evidence of bowel obstruction. There is a small fat-containing umbilical hernia.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The appendix is borderline enlarged with its distal aspect measuring up to 7-8 mm, best seen on series 301A, image 43. There is no significant fat stranding seen, but there is a suggestion of wall thickening and edema. Proximal aspect of the appendix is normal in caliber. Findings could represent an early or mild ____, and clinical correlation is recommended. Remaining pelvic loops of bowel are normal. Distal ureters, bladder, uterus, adnexa are unremarkable. No free fluid is seen. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  BONE WINDOWS: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous abnormalities are seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric pain radiating to the RLQ, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia.  Initial labs were largely unremarkable, except for slightly elevated glucose. The CT scan reveals a borderline enlarged appendix with possible wall thickening and edema, suggestive of early or mild appendicitis.  While the other abdominal organs appear normal on CT, the clinical picture combined with the CT findings points towards appendicitis as the most likely diagnosis.

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute epigastric pain radiating to the RLQ, along with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia.  Initial labs were largely unremarkable. The CT scan reveals a borderline enlarged appendix with possible wall thickening and edema, suggestive of early or mild appendicitis.  Given the patient's symptoms and the CT findings, appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis. Other possibilities include gastroenteritis or mesenteric adenitis, although the CT findings make these less likely.  Cholecystitis and pancreatitis were effectively ruled out by the normal CT and lipase.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Gastroenteritis
3. Mesenteric adenitis
4. Cholecystitis
5. Pancreatitis

Treatment: Given the suspicion for early appendicitis, a conservative approach with close monitoring and serial abdominal exams is warranted.  This includes:

* **NPO (nothing by mouth):**  To rest the bowel and prevent further irritation.
* **IV fluids:** To maintain hydration due to vomiting and diarrhea.
* **Pain management:**  Administer analgesics such as IV morphine or hydromorphone as needed, carefully monitoring respiratory status.
* **Serial abdominal exams:**  Monitor for worsening tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, or other signs of peritonitis.
* **Repeat CT scan:**  If symptoms worsen or do not improve within 12-24 hours, a repeat CT scan can help assess for progression of appendicitis.
* **Surgical consultation:**  A surgical consult should be obtained early for evaluation and potential appendectomy if the diagnosis is confirmed or if the patient's condition deteriorates.
* **Antibiotics:**  While not routinely indicated for uncomplicated appendicitis, antibiotics may be considered in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or if there are signs of perforation or abscess formation.  Broad-spectrum coverage with a drug like piperacillin-tazobactam or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone) and metronidazole would be appropriate.

If the patient's symptoms improve with conservative management, they can be transitioned to a clear liquid diet and eventually discharged with close follow-up.  If symptoms worsen or there are signs of perforation, an appendectomy should be performed without delay.
