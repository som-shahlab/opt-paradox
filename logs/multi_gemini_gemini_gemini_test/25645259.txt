HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
The patient was at baseline state of health until 8 days ago,  when he was woken up at night by severe lower abdominal pain. The pain was  crushing in character, 7 out of 10 in intensity, intermittently  returning every ___ min, and each time lasting for ___ min  then regressing but not completely resolving. It gradually  worsened until 2 days ago, when the pain became more localized  to the RLQ with radiation to the entire lower abdomen. He also  reported tenderness in the RLQ, and was not able to sleep well  over the past few days because of pain. Of note, while working  as a ___, he noticed that bumps on the road worsened  his pain. However, the pain did not interfere with his ability  to eat (last meal this morning: coffee, crackers, cheese) and  was not exacerbated by food intake. It was not associated with  any nausea or vomiting, decreased appetite, indigestion,  diarrhea, melena or hematochezia. Does have constipation at  baseline, no recent exacerbation, BM every morning. No tenesmus  or rectal urgency. It was not radiating to the back, flanks, or  testicles. He decided to come in today as the pain was continuing to worsen.    Past Medical History: PMH: -Allergic rhinitis -Hemorrhoids -Low back pain -Hyperlipidemia   Social History: Works as a ___. Lives with wife and 3 children in ___. Denies smoking tobaccos. Denies drinking EtOH. No illicit drug use.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute lower abdominal pain that has worsened over the past 8 days. The initial crushing character, intermittent nature, and worsening with bumps on the road raise suspicion for renal colic. However, the subsequent localization to the RLQ, tenderness, and lack of radiation to the back, flanks, or testicles point towards a different etiology, possibly appendicitis.  I need more information to differentiate between these and other possible diagnoses.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation including McBurney's point, Rovsing's sign, obturator sign, psoas sign), rectal exam

ToolMessage:
"GENERAL: Looks well; in moderate discomfort from abdominal pain  when moving NEURO: Alert and oriented x 3 CARDIAC: RRR no M/R/G LUNGS: CTA bilaterally ABDOMEN: +BS. Non-distended. Exquisitely tender to both light  and deep palpation localized to RLQ near the iliac fossa. +  Involuntary guarding. + Some pain w/ the writer bumping of the  patient bed. + Rovsing's sign. ? of rebound tenderness. No  hepatomegaly."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute lower abdominal pain localized to the RLQ, with tenderness, involuntary guarding, positive Rovsing's sign, and possible rebound tenderness strongly suggests appendicitis.  The worsening pain, lack of gastrointestinal symptoms like nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, and the absence of radiation to the back, flanks, or testicles further support this diagnosis. While the initial crushing and intermittent nature of the pain raised the possibility of renal colic, the subsequent localization and physical exam findings make this less likely.  The patient's occupation involving driving and bumps worsening the pain could be explained by the jarring movements exacerbating the peritoneal irritation in appendicitis. I have enough information to make a presumptive diagnosis.
Action: done
