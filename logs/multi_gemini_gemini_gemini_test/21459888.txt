HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
The patient is a ___ w Crohn's disease s/p SB  resection/ileostomy (___), ileocecectomy (___) and I&D perirectal abscess x 2 (___) now  on Remicade xfer from OSH w epigastric pain x 10 hours, now  resolved. Patient in usual state of health until 1am on day of  presentation when she awoke from sleep w severe, non-radiating  epigastric pain. No associated symptoms - no fever, chills,  nausea or vomiting. No previous episodes of similar pain. Pain was unrelenting prompting presentation to OSH ED where pain  resolved following administration of IV analgesic. Labs at OSH  were within normal limits though CT scan had concern for  cholecystitis as well as R sided colitis. Transferred to ___ for further evaluation and management. Surgery consult  obtained.  On surgery evaluation, patient states that prior pain has  resolved. Otherwise reports that she is well. Tolerating diet.  Passing flatus and daily BM. Denies fever, chills, chest pain,  shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, change in bowel pattern,  constipation, diarrhea, dietary change, blood per rectum, dysurea. Does endorse intermittent perirectal pain w drainage  from prior fistula tract though this has not bothered her enough  to seek care for it.     Past Medical History: PNC: *) ___ ___ by LMP *) Labs: O+/Ab-/RPRNR/RI/HepBSAg neg/HIV neg/ *) Screening: LR Panorama FFS post placenta ISSUES: - initial tox screen positive for THC, barbituates,  buprenorphine -> neg tox screen since per records - posterior "partial previa" ___ efw 770g 49%  for c/s  POB: G1 ruptured ectopic s/p open salpingectomy (pfannensteal)    Social History: ___ Family History: + for MI in maternal grandfather.  MGM with hypothyroidism and  elevated cholesterol


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease with multiple abdominal surgeries, including small bowel resection and ileostomy.  She presented with severe epigastric pain that resolved after analgesia.  While the outside CT scan suggested cholecystitis and right-sided colitis, her Crohn's disease makes the latter more likely.  Given the resolution of pain, it's important to determine if the colitis is active and if there are any other complications of Crohn's, such as abscess or fistula.  Additionally, given the history of perirectal pain and drainage, evaluating the fistula is necessary.  Finally, her surgical history raises the possibility of adhesions or other post-surgical complications as a cause of pain.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs are largely normal, except for an elevated lipase.  While her initial presentation suggested a Crohn's flare, the elevated lipase raises concern for pancreatitis or another pancreatic issue.  Given her history of cholecystitis on the outside CT, it's important to differentiate between these possibilities.  Additionally, obtaining the CRP, ESR, and fecal calprotectin will help assess Crohn's disease activity.

Action Input: CRP, ESR, fecal calprotectin

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs are notable for an elevated lipase, raising concern for pancreatitis.  Although the initial concern was for a Crohn's flare, the lack of CRP, ESR, and fecal calprotectin data makes it difficult to assess disease activity.  The patient's pain has resolved, and her other labs are normal.  Given the outside CT scan findings and the elevated lipase, further imaging is warranted to evaluate the pancreas and biliary tree.  A right-sided abdominal ultrasound would be helpful to assess for cholecystitis, and an MRCP would be beneficial to evaluate the pancreatic duct for any signs of pancreatitis or other pathology.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Abdominal ultrasound, MRCP

ToolMessage:
"MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC) is available and matches one of the requested studies. Here is the full report:  MRCP:  EXAMINATION: MRCP  TECHNIQUE: T1- and T2-weighted multiplanar images of the abdomen were acquired in a 1.5 T magnet. Intravenous contrast: Save mL Gadavist Oral contrast: 1 cc of Gadavist mixed with 50 cc of water was administered for oral contrast.  FINDINGS: Lower Thorax: There is a small right pleural effusion. There is bibasilar atelectasis.  Liver: There is transient mosaic enhancement of the liver parenchyma which is nonspecific but can be seen in the setting of liver toxicity for example due to medications. There is mild periportal edema. No focal liver lesions. There is trace upper abdominal ascites.  Biliary: Compared to the outside hospital CT of ___ the radiodense stone in the gallbladder neck is now in the gallbladder fundus and the gallbladder is no longer distended. There is mild gallbladder wall edema. There is no intra or extrahepatic biliary dilatation with the common bile duct measuring 3 mm.  Pancreas: The pancreas is normal in signal and bulk with no peripancreatic stranding.  Spleen: The spleen is normal in size measuring 10 cm  Adrenal Glands: The adrenal glands are unremarkable  Kidneys: The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically with no hydronephrosis or masses.  Gastrointestinal Tract: The small and large bowel are normal in caliber with no evidence of obstruction. Although not optimized for visualization of the bowel, there is fluid in transverse mesocolon with hyperenhancing mucosa of the transverse colon suggesting mild transverse colitis. The remainder of the colon is not visualized.  Lymph Nodes: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  Vasculature: The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber. Hepatic arterial anatomy is conventional. The portal and hepatic veins are patent.  Osseous and Soft Tissue Structures: Normal bone marrow signal  NOTIFICATION: Change in wet read discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 09:30 on ___ via telephone.  Note: The abdominal ultrasound that was also requested is not available in the provided imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with severe epigastric pain that resolved with analgesics.  She has a history of Crohn's disease and previous abdominal surgeries.  Initial labs were notable for elevated lipase, raising concern for pancreatitis.  The MRCP showed resolution of the previously seen gallbladder obstruction, mild gallbladder wall edema, and no biliary dilation.  The pancreas appeared normal, and there was evidence of mild transverse colitis.  Given the resolution of pain, normal pancreas on MRCP, and the history of Crohn's, the most likely diagnosis is a Crohn's flare with mild transverse colitis.  The elevated lipase could be related to the gallbladder issue or another transient process.  The patient is currently stable and tolerating a diet.  Continued monitoring and management of her Crohn's disease are recommended.
