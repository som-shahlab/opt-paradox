HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with no PMH who presents with 3 days history of lower  abdominal pain. This pain never happen to her before. Pain is  constant, ___ in intensity, mostly in LLQ, no radiation. Denies  N/V/F, reports some chills, Last BM was 3 days ago before the  pain started and it was hard stool. Last flatus was this  morning. Of note, pt went an outpatient clinic two days ago  where she was diagnosed with back strain and was sent home with  pain medication. However, Pt's pain persists, she went her ObGyn  this morning where she was found to have elevated white count  and was advised to come to ___ for further evaluation.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: None  Past Surgical History: c/s x 2, fatty tissue removal from C-section scar, iud placement   Social History: ___ Family History: grandmother with diabetes


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with lower abdominal pain, constipation, chills, and leukocytosis, raising suspicion for diverticulitis, although other diagnoses like ovarian torsion or a gynecological issue are possible given her history of C-sections.  A physical exam, including abdominal and pelvic exams, is necessary to assess for tenderness, masses, or peritoneal signs.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam, pelvic exam, vital signs

ToolMessage:
"Physical Exam upon admission: Vitals:98.9 110 134/85 16 100%RA GEN: NAD. Alert, oriented x3. HEENT: No scleral icterus. Mucous membranes moist. CV: RRR PULM: Unlabored breathing, CTAB ABD: Soft, nondistended, tender to palpation in bilateral  abdominal area, more so in the LLQ with some voluntary guarding,  no abdominal rigidity. No masses. EXT: Warm without ___ edema/c/c  Physical Exam"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with LLQ pain, constipation, chills, leukocytosis, and tenderness in the LLQ on physical exam increases the suspicion for diverticulitis.  The lack of rebound tenderness or rigidity argues against a perforated viscus, but imaging is needed to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities like ovarian pathology or appendicitis (though the location makes this less likely).
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"There are two CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast studies available. I'll provide both reports since they appear to be from different dates (one seems to be a follow-up to the other):  First CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial MDCT images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis after the administration of IV contrast only. Sagittal and coronal reformatted images were obtained and reviewed.  FINDINGS: LUNG BASES: The bases of the lungs are clear. There is no nodule, consolidation, or pleural effusion. The base of the heart is normal. There is no pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: The liver is normal in shape and contour. There are no focal hepatic lesions. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary duct dilation. The portal vein is patent. There is no portal venous air. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys are normal, without focal renal lesions, pyelonephritis, or hydronephrosis. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically. The stomach is collapsed and unremarkable. There are secondary inflammatory changes of multiple small bowel loops in the left lower quadrant adjacent. The small bowel is otherwise unremarkable. There is no evidence of small-bowel obstruction. The abdominal vasculature is normal in course and caliber. There is no abdominal, retroperitoneal, or mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  PELVIS: There are several scattered diverticula in the sigmoid colon. In the distal sigmoid colon, there is focal wall thickening and significant surrounding stranding with multiple locules of free air (2, 54). This is most likely due to a contained perforated ____. No discrete abscess is identified. The remainder of the colon is unremarkable. The appendix is visualized and normal. Within the uterus, there is an IUD. The tip of the left horn of the IUD extends just minimally through the uterine wall (2, 67) into the surrounding fat. This is better evaluated on the ultrasound from earlier today. A small left ovarian cyst is also better characterized on the ultrasound. The bladder is unremarkable. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There are no concerning lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions. There are no significant degenerative changes.  Second CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: TECHNIQUE: MDCT acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis were displayed with 5mm slice thickness with oral and intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness.  CT ABDOMEN: The visualized lung bases demonstrate scarring or atelectasis in the right middle lobe. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The liver is normal without intra- or extra-hepatic bile duct dilation. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast promptly without hydronephrosis. There is no bowel obstruction. The abdominal aorta is of normal caliber throughout. The main portal vein, splenic vein and SMV are patent. Prominent mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes are not enlarged by CT size criteria, but have increased in number since ___, likely reactive.  CT PELVIS: Compared to the prior study, there are now multiple new intra-pelvic fluid collections, some with with air-fluid levels. The largest is in the rectouterine pouch measuring 8.0 x 7.5 x 4.7 cm. Another fluid collection in the mid pelvis is 6.3 cm TV x 3.6 cm AP x 5.8 cm CC with an adjacent smaller collection (3:58). Smaller collections are seen adjacent to the uterine fundus (3:64) and along the left pelvic side wall (3:69). There is no extraluminal contrast. Pelvic fat stranding and free fluid are related to perforated sigmoid ____. Prominent inguinal lymph nodes have slightly increased in size from the prior study, likely reactive. Again noted is the malpositioned intrauterine device, better seen on the prior pelvic ultrasound.  BONE WINDOWS: No bone finding suspicious for infection or malignancy is seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan confirms the presence of sigmoid diverticulitis with contained perforation and surrounding inflammation. The development of new intra-pelvic fluid collections with air-fluid levels on the second CT suggests abscess formation.  The malpositioned IUD is noted but does not appear to be the primary cause of her current symptoms. The patient's clinical picture, physical exam findings, and imaging results are consistent with a diagnosis of complicated diverticulitis with abscess formation.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with LLQ pain, constipation, chills, leukocytosis, and tenderness in the LLQ, combined with the CT findings of sigmoid diverticulitis with contained perforation and associated abscesses, confirms the diagnosis of complicated diverticulitis.  The IUD malposition is noted but does not appear to be the primary cause of her current symptoms.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Complicated Diverticulitis (with abscess formation)
2. Uncomplicated Diverticulitis
3. Ovarian Cyst (incidental finding)
4. Malpositioned IUD (incidental finding)
5. Appendicitis (less likely given LLQ pain)

Treatment: Admit the patient for IV antibiotics (e.g., metronidazole and ciprofloxacin or a carbapenem for broader coverage given the abscesses) and bowel rest (NPO).  Pain control should be provided with IV analgesics.  Serial abdominal exams and repeat CT imaging should be performed to monitor the abscesses.  If the abscesses do not improve with medical management, or if there are signs of worsening infection or peritonitis, surgical consultation for percutaneous or surgical drainage should be considered.  After the acute episode resolves, colonoscopy should be considered to evaluate for underlying colon pathology and rule out malignancy.  The malpositioned IUD should be addressed with her gynecologist after the acute diverticulitis is managed.
