HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ year old ___ woman with a  history of infectious colitis and diverticulosis who presents  with severe, left-sided abdominal pain. The patient reports that  she began experiencing the abdominal pain 2 months ago, but that  the pain has become acutely worse in the past two days. Two  months ago, she saw her doctor and was given antibiotics for for  infection in her colon which helped the pain to resolve. The  pain returned yesterday in the same location and feels the same  as her most recent episode.  She rates the pain a ___ in  severity. ___ denies nausea or vomiting, fevers, sweats.  Patient reports having chills last night. She reports having ___  nonbloody stools yesterday with her last being bowel movement  being today. Ms. ___ has had a good appetite and last ate  yesterday in the mid-afternoon.  Her last colonoscopy on ___  showed severe diverticulosis, and she was scheduled for a one  year follow-up colonoscopy this ___ (due to poor bowel prep).   Patient reports increased urinary frequency but denies dysuria,  hematuria. She denies chest pain, SOB, lightheadedness.   Past Medical History: Chronic low back pain- degenerative lumbar spondylosis Thyroid nodule Depression    Social History: ___ Family History: No family history of GI problems. Sister has a thyroid condition  but she is not certain of the details.  Sister had lung cancer.   Mother with cardiovascular disease.  Diabetes mellitus in 3  sisters and mother.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's recurrent left-sided abdominal pain, history of infectious colitis and diverticulosis, and recent chills raise concerns about a possible recurrence of colitis, potentially diverticulitis.  Given the prior CT scan showing diverticulosis, I need to assess for current inflammation and complications.  Additionally, her increased urinary frequency warrants investigation to rule out urinary tract infection or other related issues.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, history, and lab results suggest a possible recurrent infectious colitis or diverticulitis. The elevated white blood cell count and neutrophils point towards an inflammatory process. While the UA is largely normal, the few bacteria present could suggest a possible UTI, although less likely given the absence of other urinary symptoms.  The absence of stool studies limits my ability to assess for infectious causes of colitis.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is necessary to evaluate for diverticulitis, abscess formation, or other intra-abdominal pathology.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT scan of abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT scan of abdomen and pelvis with contrast. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were obtained from the dome of the liver to the pubic symphysis after the administration of IV contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were provided and reviewed. DLP: 449.47 mGy-cm.  ABDOMEN: The visualized bases of the lungs are clear. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The imaged portion of the heart is normal. There is no pericardial effusion. The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesions. The gallbladder is normal and there is no intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The spleen and pancreas are unremarkable. There is slight fullness to the right adrenal gland, unchanged from prior exam. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast without hydronephrosis. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. No free air or free fluid is seen. The abdominal aorta and its major branches are unremarkable. Incidental note is made of a low lying, retroaortic left renal vein. Multiple diverticula are seen scattered throughout the colon with fat stranding seen near the ascending colon. There is no extraluminal air or fluid collection.  PELVIS: The bladder and rectum are normal. At least one fibroid, measuring 4 cm is seen within the uterus. The appendix is not visualized. There is no inguinal or pelvic lymphadenopathy.  BONES: There are no suspicious osseous lesions. Minor degenerative changes of the lower lumbar spine are marked by anterior osteophytosis, particularly at L5. Small posterior disc bulges are seen at L3-L4 through L5-S1."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, history, lab results, and CT findings suggest a diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. The CT scan confirms the presence of diverticula and pericolonic fat stranding, indicative of inflammation.  The absence of abscess or perforation is reassuring. The elevated white blood cell count further supports the diagnosis of an inflammatory process.  The other findings on the CT scan, such as the uterine fibroid and degenerative changes in the lumbar spine, are incidental and not related to the patient's chief complaint.  I have enough information to make a diagnosis.
Action: done

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**

Treatment:  Given the patient's presentation and CT findings, I recommend outpatient treatment for uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. This includes:
1. Antibiotics:  A combination of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole is recommended for 7-10 days to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.  Alternatively, amoxicillin-clavulanate can be used.
2. Bowel Rest:  The patient should follow a clear liquid diet for a few days until the pain subsides, then gradually advance to a low-fiber diet.
3. Pain Management:  Prescribe appropriate pain medication such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen.  Avoid opioids if possible due to the risk of constipation.
4. Follow-up:  The patient should be instructed to follow up with their primary care physician or gastroenterologist within a week to assess response to treatment.  If symptoms worsen or do not improve, a repeat CT scan may be necessary to evaluate for complications.  Advise the patient to return to the ER if they develop severe abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, or bloody stools.  Consider a colonoscopy after resolution of the acute episode to evaluate the extent of diverticulosis and rule out other pathology.
5. Patient Education:  Educate the patient about diverticulitis, its causes, and prevention strategies, including a high-fiber diet and adequate hydration.
