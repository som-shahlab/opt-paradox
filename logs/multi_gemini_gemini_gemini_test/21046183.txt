HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Mr. ___ is a ___ presenting with abdominal pain that woke him  from sleep at 3AM this morning, associated with nausea/vomiting  x3. He was in his normal state of health until last night after  he drove home from ___. He fell asleep for 45 minutes  and then developed severe abdominal pain. He describes the pain  as dull and nonradiating, located around his umbilicus. No fever  or chills. No family or personal history of inflammatory bowel  disease. Notes decreased appetite since the onset of symptoms.  Given continued abdominal pain, he presented to the ED for  further evaluation.    Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: FH: no family history of inflammatory bowel disease


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The onset after a short sleep followed by severe pain raises concern for a surgical abdomen.  I need to gather more information to narrow the differential diagnosis, which includes appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, small bowel obstruction, and diverticulitis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation including McBurney's point and Murphy's sign), rectal exam

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and RLQ tenderness with a positive Rovsing's sign.  This makes appendicitis the most likely diagnosis.  While a CT scan would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis, the patient's presentation is highly suggestive of appendicitis and warrants surgical consultation.

Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. The pain started suddenly after a short sleep, is periumbilical initially, and now localized to the RLQ.  He has a positive Rovsing's sign, which suggests peritoneal irritation in the RLQ.  The absence of rebound tenderness and guarding doesn't rule out appendicitis.  While his vital signs are currently stable, the overall clinical picture points towards appendicitis. Other differentials like cholecystitis, pancreatitis, small bowel obstruction, and diverticulitis are less likely given the location of the pain and the positive Rovsing's sign.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Early Cholecystitis
3. Small bowel obstruction
4. Diverticulitis
5. Pancreatitis

Treatment: 
* Consult surgery immediately.
* Make patient NPO.
* Initiate IV fluids for hydration (e.g., Normal Saline).
* Administer analgesics for pain management (e.g., IV Morphine or other appropriate pain medication).
* Obtain a CBC, CMP, and a pregnancy test (if applicable).
* Consider a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis if there is diagnostic uncertainty.  
* Begin antibiotics with coverage for anaerobic and gram-negative bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin, or combination of metronidazole and ceftriaxone) after surgical consultation.
* Appendectomy is the definitive treatment and should be performed expeditiously once the diagnosis is confirmed.
