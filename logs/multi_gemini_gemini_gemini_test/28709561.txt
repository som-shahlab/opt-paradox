HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with 3 days of abdominal pain.  Started diffuse and RUQ but  has now migrated to RLQ.  No N/V/D.  Still has somewhat of an  appetite with last meal this morning.  Passing flatus and having  normal bowel movements.  No fevers or chills.  No hematuria or  flank pain or dysuria.     Past Medical History: PMH: hypercholesterolemia PSH: none   Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a 3-day history of abdominal pain migrating from diffuse and RUQ to RLQ. The absence of N/V/D, presence of appetite and normal bowel movements, and lack of fevers or chills suggest against a severe gastrointestinal infection or obstruction. However, the migrating pain pattern raises concern for appendicitis.  I need to gather more information through physical examination to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness in the RLQ.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on RLQ tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign, Murphy's sign,  rectal exam

ToolMessage:
"VS:  99.8  86  126/69  16  100%RA  Gen: NAD AAOx3 HEENT: anicteric CV: RRR Pulm: CTA b/l Abd: soft, nondistended, RLQ TTP over McBurneys point with guarding but no rebound.  No flank pain.  No hernias. Ext: no edema"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with a 3-day history of abdominal pain that has migrated to the RLQ.  While they lack fever, nausea, vomiting, or anorexia, the RLQ tenderness, guarding, and positive McBurney's point tenderness revealed on physical exam strongly suggest appendicitis. Although the patient is currently stable, the progression of symptoms and physical exam findings warrant surgical consultation for possible appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric adenitis

5. Constipation

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for possible appendectomy.  NPO status.  IV fluids for hydration.  Pain management with IV analgesics (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone).  Administer pre-operative antibiotics (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of metronidazole and ceftriaxone) as per surgical recommendations.  If CT confirms appendicitis, proceed with appendectomy.
