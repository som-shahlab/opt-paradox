HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old female who presents to the ED with abdominal pain that started around 9 am this morning. At first the pain was mostly left sided and felt like menstrual cramps. She took Motrin with some mild improvement in symptoms. Pain then returned in her RLQ and is worse with any movement.  Low grade fever to 99 at home. Denies chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. Mild constipation for which she took milk of magnesia today and had a normal bowel movement. + anorexia. She has an  IUD and rarely has menses.    Past Medical History: PMH: none; had excessive bleeding after giving birth PSH: IVF    Social History: ___ Family History: ___: DM, CAD, colon cancer in grandparents


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's presentation with RLQ pain, fever, and anorexia, appendicitis is high on the differential.  Other possibilities include ovarian torsion, pelvic inflammatory disease, or a gynecologic issue given her IUD. I need vital signs, a physical exam, and labs to narrow the differential.  Knowing the patient's age and family history details will help with risk stratification.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: vital signs, abdominal exam, pelvic exam

ToolMessage:
"99.6  122  121/68  16  100% RA  A&O x 3, NAD PERRL, EOMI, anicteric RRR CTAB Abdomen soft, nondistended, moderately tender in the RLQ over McBurney's point. No rebound or guarding. Normal bowel sounds. ___ warm, no edema Pelvic exam: nontender"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, fever, anorexia, and tenderness at McBurney's point increases the suspicion for appendicitis.  The normal pelvic exam decreases the likelihood of ovarian torsion or PID.  While constipation can cause abdominal pain, the location and migration of the pain, along with the fever and anorexia, make it less likely.  A CT scan would help confirm the diagnosis.  Knowing the patient's age, social history, and family history details would help with overall risk assessment, but I have enough information to recommend the next step in management.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast report from the available studies. The report combines findings for both CT abdomen and CT pelvis, which were performed together with IV contrast (Optiray). Here is the complete report:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST and CT PELVIS:  TECHNIQUE: MDCT imaging of the abdomen and pelvis was performed following the administration of 130 mL of Optiray contrast. Oral contrast was also administered. Multiplanar reformats were prepared and reviewed.  FINDINGS: Visualized lung bases are unremarkable. There is no consolidation and no effusion. There is no pulmonary nodule or mass identified. The liver is normal in size and attenuation, without focal lesions. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. The gallbladder is unremarkable, without cholelithiasis or CT evidence of acute cholecystitis. The hepatic vasculature is patent. The spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys are normal. There is no hydronephrosis. Renal parenchymal enhancement is symmetric. There are no renal mass lesions identified. The stomach, duodenum, and intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are normal in caliber and configuration. There is no bowel distention or bowel wall thickening. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal adenopathy by CT size criteria. There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen, and there is no fluid identified within the retroperitoneum. In the right lower quadrant, the likely appendix is seen extending from the cecum and extending medially over the iliac vessels. It appears slightly increased in caliber at the base, measuring up to 9 mm. Near the appendiceal tip, there is a punctate foci of hyperdensity (2:58 and 301B:24), which may represent a small appendicolith. However, the right ureter is seen to cross the iliac vessels at this level as well, and the possibility that this represents a stone within the right ureter cannot be excluded. There is no hydroureter, however, no contrast is seen within the ureter distal to this (though this may represent peristalsis). There is no significant stranding seen in the right lower quadrant. There is no free fluid or loculated fluid collection.  The distal ureters are unremarkable. The bladder is normal. A left ureteral jet is noted. No contrast is seen within distal right ureter. The uterus and adnexa are unremarkable. There is an IUD seen in standard position at the fundus. A functional follicle seen in the right ovary. The rectum and sigmoid colon are normal. There is moderate retained stool. There is no free pelvic fluid. There is no pelvic or inguinal adenopathy.  BONE WINDOWS: There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions identified."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan shows a mildly enlarged appendix with a possible appendicolith and no significant surrounding inflammation.  The radiologist also notes the possibility of a ureteral stone, but there is no hydroureter. Given the patient's presentation and the CT findings, appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis, though a ureteral stone cannot be completely ruled out.  I have enough information to recommend a surgical consult.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**

3. Ovarian torsion
4. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
5. Constipation

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for possible appendectomy.  Continue IV fluids.  Administer analgesics and antiemetics as needed.  Monitor vital signs and abdominal exam.  If the patient's symptoms worsen or do not improve, repeat CT scan or consider diagnostic laparoscopy.  If surgery is performed, pathology of the appendix should be obtained.  Discuss the possibility of a ureteral stone with the patient and arrange follow-up with urology if indicated.
