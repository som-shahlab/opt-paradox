HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with c/o abdominal pain since last ___ which started in  the epigastric region and migrated to the RLQ yesterday. No  fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.     Past Medical History: 1. Exercise-induced asthma 2. Depression  Past Surgical History :  1. Bilateral inguinal hernia repair as a child 2. Wisdom teeth    Social History: ___ Family History: Non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain migrating from the epigastric region to the RLQ, which is a classic presentation for appendicitis. However, the lack of fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea is atypical.  I need to gather more information to rule out other differential diagnoses such as mesenteric adenitis, ovarian torsion (if female), or a urological issue. A physical exam is the next step to assess for tenderness, guarding, and rebound tenderness in the RLQ.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on RLQ tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign,  rectal exam, pelvic exam (if female)

ToolMessage:
"T 99.2 HR 76  BP 153/85  RR 16  O2 100 RA Gen: NAD, AxO, pleasant CV: RRR Resp: CTA B Abd: Soft, mod tender RLQ, no rebound, no guarding Ext: Warm and well-perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical exam reveals moderate tenderness in the RLQ without rebound tenderness or guarding.  While this could still point towards appendicitis, the absence of these key findings makes it less likely.  Given the migration of pain from epigastric to RLQ, and moderate tenderness, I still need to rule out appendicitis and other differentials like mesenteric adenitis or ovarian torsion/other gynecological pathology (if female).  A CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast would be helpful to visualize the appendix and surrounding structures.  Lab tests including a CBC and CMP would also be beneficial to assess for signs of infection or other abnormalities.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP

ToolMessage:
"I'll provide the results for the requested CBC with differential and Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP).

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results (CBC and CMP) are all within normal limits.  This decreases the likelihood of an infectious process or other metabolic derangement causing the abdominal pain.  Given the migration of pain from the epigastric region to the RLQ, the moderate RLQ tenderness on physical exam, and the normal lab results, I still need to definitively rule out appendicitis.  A CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is the next best step.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the matching CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast report. Here is the full report:  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS W/CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: Volumetric CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast only, including multiplanar reformations.  CT ABDOMEN: Visualized lung bases are clear. Liver is normal. Gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are within normal limits. Kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically. There is no hydronephrosis. Stomach and intra-abdominal bowel loops are normal. There is no free air or free intraperitoneal fluid. There is no abnormal intra-abdominal lymph node.  CT PELVIS: The appendix is abnormal in appearance, with a dilated fluid-filled lumen measuring 9-10 mm in diameter. There is moderate appendiceal wall enhancement, and surrounding periappendiceal fat stranding and numerous small lymph nodes. There is no free air, or other definite sign of perforation. There is no free fluid in the right lower quadrant, but there is a small amount of free fluid in the lower pelvis around the rectum. The remaining pelvic loops of large and small bowel are within normal limits. Urinary bladder, prostate, and seminal vesicles are normal. There is no osseous lesion suspicious for malignancy."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with abdominal pain migrating from the epigastric region to the RLQ.  Physical exam revealed moderate RLQ tenderness without rebound or guarding.  Lab results (CBC and CMP) were normal.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, demonstrating a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with wall enhancement and periappendiceal fat stranding.  Although there is no definitive sign of perforation on the CT, the presence of free fluid in the pelvis raises concern for microperforation.
