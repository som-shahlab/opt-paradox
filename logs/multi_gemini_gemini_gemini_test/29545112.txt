HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This patient is a ___ year old male who complains of ABDOMINAL PAIN. Right-sided abdomen times one day. Positive chills and rigors. No definitive fevers. No nausea vomiting diarrhea. No chest pain or shortness of breath. History of hernia repairs no other abdominal surgeries.    Past Medical History: pt denies    Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Abdominal pain can have various causes, ranging from benign to life-threatening conditions. Given the patient's presentation with right-sided abdominal pain, chills, and rigors, it's crucial to consider appendicitis, cholecystitis, or even kidney stones among the possibilities.  A physical exam is the first step to narrow down the differential diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation), McBurney's point tenderness, Murphy's sign,  vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate)

ToolMessage:
"On admission: Vitals: 98.0 86 125/67 16 98RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, nontender, no rebound or guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses DRE: normal tone, no gross or occult blood Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right-sided abdominal pain, chills, and rigors, raising suspicion for conditions like appendicitis, cholecystitis, or kidney stones. While the physical exam reveals a soft, non-distended, and non-tender abdomen, the presence of chills and rigors warrants further investigation. Laboratory tests are necessary to assess for signs of infection or inflammation and to evaluate organ function.
Action: laboratory tests

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's primary complaint is right-sided abdominal pain accompanied by chills and rigors.  The physical exam did not reveal localized tenderness, but the lab results show leukocytosis with neutrophilia, suggesting an infectious or inflammatory process.  Although the urinalysis shows some abnormalities, they are not strongly suggestive of a urinary tract infection.  Given the persistent chills and rigors, along with elevated WBCs, imaging is necessary to visualize the abdominal organs and identify the source of the patient's symptoms.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I can provide the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report from the available imaging studies:  CT ABDOMEN & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Contrast-enhanced axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pelvic outlet. Coronal and sagittal reformations were provided.  FINDINGS: Heart size is normal and without pericardial effusion. Lung bases are without focal opacification. Tiny centrilobular nodules are noted in the left lower lobe which are non-specific but may be related to aspiration.  ABDOMEN: The liver is homogeneous in attenuation without discrete masses or lesions. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation identified. The gallbladder is moderately distended with significant mural edema and two large peripherally calcified gallstones one of which appears impacted within the gallbladder neck. Of note, the gallbladder mucosa demonstrates patchy hyperenhancement with an outpouching noted along the lateral aspect. Trace free fluid noted within the dependent portions of the abdomen. Evaluation for pericholecystic fluid is limited given surrounding inflammation. Findings are concerning for complicated by contained rupture.  The pancreas, spleen, and bilateral adrenal glands are normal. Bilateral kidneys are without concerning masses or hydronephrosis. Multiple rounded hypodensities are identified bilaterally, too small to characterize, but are most consistent with simple cysts. A large parapelvic cyst is noted on the left. No hydroureter identified. Bladder is collapsed and grossly normal. Prostate is normal. Seminal vesicles are prominent. The stomach and small bowel are unremarkable.  PELVIS: Sigmoid diverticulosis without surrounding inflammatory change present to suggest diverticulitis. The appendix is visualized and normal. The rectum is unremarkable.  No lymphadenopathy identified. Minimal atherosclerotic changes identified within the aorta without aneurysmal change or dissection. Ostia of the celiac and superior mesenteric arteries are widely patent. The hepatic, left, right and main portal veins and their major tributaries are widely patent.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions identified."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with right-sided abdominal pain, chills, and rigors.  The physical exam was relatively benign, but the lab results showed leukocytosis and neutrophilia, suggesting an infectious or inflammatory process. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis with findings concerning for complicated cholecystitis with contained rupture, including significant mural edema, impacted gallstones, and patchy mucosal hyperenhancement.  The other abdominal organs appear normal.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with right-sided abdominal pain, chills, and rigors.  Initial physical exam findings were unremarkable, but lab results revealed leukocytosis, suggesting an infectious or inflammatory process. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, revealing a moderately distended gallbladder with significant mural edema, gallstones (one impacted in the neck), patchy mucosal hyperenhancement, and an outpouching – all highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis likely complicated by contained rupture.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Cholecystitis with contained rupture
2. Cholelithiasis
3. Appendicitis (ruled out by CT)
4. Kidney stones (ruled out by CT)
5. Diverticulitis (ruled out by CT)

Treatment:  The patient requires emergent surgical consultation for a likely laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  Given the potential for a contained rupture, a short course of broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., Piperacillin/Tazobactam or Ceftriaxone/Metronidazole) should be initiated.  The patient should be made NPO and given IV fluids for hydration.  Pain management should be provided with analgesics (e.g., Morphine or Hydromorphone).  Post-operatively, the patient should be monitored for complications such as bleeding, infection, or bile leak.  Early ambulation and a gradual return to a regular diet are encouraged.
