HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ yoM with 3 week history of worsenign RUQ pain.  Patient was seen by PCP last week and treated with 1 week of  cipro/flagyl for presumed diveritculitis.  A CT scan at that time had shown mild evidence of inflammation around the colon with diffuse diverticulosis   Past Medical History: PMH: HTN, HCHOL PSgH: cyst removed on upper abdomen, warts removed on left neck.    Social History: ___ Family History: non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with worsening RUQ pain despite treatment for presumed diverticulitis.  The location of the pain (RUQ) is not typical for diverticulitis, which usually causes LLQ pain.  The CT scan showing mild inflammation around the colon could be incidental.  Given the persistent RUQ pain, I need to investigate other potential causes of RUQ pain, such as biliary pathology (cholecystitis, choledocholithiasis), hepatic pathology (hepatitis, abscess), or other gastrointestinal issues (peptic ulcer disease, pancreatitis).

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs are essentially normal, except the amylase which is missing.  The persistent RUQ pain despite normal labs and a previous CT scan showing only mild inflammation around the colon warrants further investigation with imaging focused on the biliary tree.
Action: imaging
Action Input: RUQ Ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"Here is the RIGHT UPPER QUADRANT ULTRASOUND report:  LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN): The liver echotexture is normal. There is a 1.3 x 1.0 x 0.9 cm echogenic focus in the right lobe of the liver which is likely a calcified granuloma given the posterior shadowing. There is no intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation and the common bile duct measures 4 mm. The main portal vein is patent with hepatopetal flow. The gallbladder is not distended. There is a 1.4 x 1.2-cm stone in the neck of the gallbladder. There is no pericholecystic fluid or wall edema. However, the wall is borderline thick. There are areas with ring-down artifact suggesting adenomyosis. The pancreas is not well visualized due to overlying bowel gas. There is no free fluid in the abdomen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with worsening RUQ pain for 3 weeks, treated for presumed diverticulitis without improvement.  The RUQ ultrasound shows a gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder with borderline wall thickening and ring-down artifact suggesting adenomyosis.  While there is no pericholecystic fluid or wall edema to definitively diagnose acute cholecystitis, the presence of a gallstone in the neck of the gallbladder along with the patient's persistent RUQ pain makes it highly suspicious for acute cholecystitis or symptomatic cholelithiasis.  The other laboratory values are normal, and the liver appears normal on ultrasound, making other causes of RUQ pain less likely.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**

The patient should be educated about the procedure and potential complications.  Pain management should be provided with NSAIDs or other analgesics as needed.  A low-fat diet may be recommended.
