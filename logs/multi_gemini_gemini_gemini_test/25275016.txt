Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ hx CAD s/p CABG, DM, HTN, referred for concern of  cholecystitis.  History taken from ___ documentation and patient. She reports  that she developed acute epigastric pain yesterday morning  without apparent trigger. She had never had this pain before. It  was an aching pain that ranged from between 5 to 8 out of ten.  She had accompanying malaise, for which she called her PCP and  presented to her office. The pain radiated to her upper back.  There were no other associated symptoms; nothing made it better  or worse. Per ___ documentation, she went to her PCP's office  where labs were drawn and she had a KUB done; she was sent home  on famotidine. At home, she was called that her labs were  abnormal and was referred to the ___ ___. She denies fevers or  chills. Per ___ dashboard, WBC was 19K earlier today, with lipase  greater than 3000.  In the ___, initial VS were: 99.1 78 171/42 18 99% RA.     ___ physical exam was recorded as: none recorded.  ___ labs were notable for: WBC 11.9. H/H ___ with MCV 115.

If continued clinical  concern, a HIDA can be obtained for further evaluation  EKG showed: Sinus bradycardia with ectopic beats. Low voltage,  no ischemic change.   Patient was given: ___ 01:06 IV Ampicillin-Sulbactam 3 g  ___ 01:06 IV Morphine Sulfate 2 mg  ___ 01:06 IVF 1000 mL NS   ERCP and Surgery were paged from the ___, no recommendations  left.   Transfer VS were: 98.0 54 123/82 16 95% RA.   When seen on the floor, patient is comfortable, engaged. She  endorses mild upper abdominal pain. She denies HA, vision  change, cough, congestion, chest pain, shortness of breath,  palpitations, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, urinary  frequency or pain with urination, pains of the muscle or joints,  new rashes or lesions, joint swelling, change in weight,  appetite or mood.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  A ten point ROS was conducted and was negative except as above  in the HPI.   Past Medical History: CAD s/p CABG ___. Grafts: Left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending; saphenous vein graft to the marginal branch of the posterior descending artery.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has epigastric pain radiating to the back, elevated lipase, and abnormal liver function tests.  The ultrasound suggests possible cholecystitis, but it is inconclusive due to shadowing stones. Given the patient's history of CAD s/p CABG, DM, HTN, it's crucial to rule out other serious conditions like pancreatitis and myocardial infarction.  The patient also has leukocytosis, which could indicate infection.  A more definitive imaging study is needed to assess the gallbladder, and further investigation is required to determine the cause of the elevated lipase and liver enzymes.
Action: imaging
Action Input: HIDA scan, CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested HIDA scan and CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast are not available among the provided imaging studies. The available studies include ultrasound of liver/gallbladder, MRCP, and two chest x-rays."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with epigastric pain radiating to the back, significantly elevated lipase, and abnormal liver function tests. While the ultrasound suggests possible cholecystitis, it is inconclusive due to shadowing stones. Given the patient's history of CAD s/p CABG, DM, HTN, and leukocytosis, it's crucial to differentiate between cholecystitis, pancreatitis, and other potential diagnoses such as cholangitis or even myocardial infarction.  Since a HIDA scan and CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast are not available, an MRCP can provide valuable information about the biliary tree and pancreatic duct, helping to identify gallstones, obstruction, or other abnormalities.  Reviewing the available chest x-rays can help assess for any cardiopulmonary issues, although the EKG currently doesn't show signs of acute ischemia.  The elevated WBC and abnormal UA suggest a possible infectious component, which needs to be considered in the diagnosis and management.
Action: imaging
Action Input: MRCP, Chest X-Ray review

ToolMessage:
"Here is the MRCP report:  MRCP (MR ABD W&W/OC):  TECHNIQUE: T1- and T2-weighted multiplanar images of the abdomen were acquired in a 1.5 T magnet. Intravenous contrast: 6 mL Gadavist. Oral contrast: 1 cc of Gadavist mixed with 50 cc of water was administered for oral contrast.  FINDINGS: Lower Thorax: The imaged lower thorax demonstrates interstitial edema bilaterally and trace bilateral pleural effusions. Heart size is moderately enlarged, but there is no pericardial effusion. Susceptibility artifact from sternal wires is noted.  Hepatobiliary: The liver is normal in morphology with no evidence of hepatic steatosis. There is no intrahepatic biliary dilation. The common bile duct is normal in caliber with no filling defects. The gallbladder is mildly distended, containing a 3.6 x 2.3 cm T2 hypointense stone (05:32). There is circumferential gallbladder wall edema. Focal fundal adenomyomatosis is noted.  Pancreas: The pancreas is normal in signal intensity. The pancreatic duct is normal in caliber. Within the pancreatic head, there are 2 millimetric T2 hyperintense foci (05:30), likely representing side-branch IPMNs. There is no peripancreatic inflammatory change to suggest ____.  Spleen: The spleen is normal in size and signal intensity.  Adrenal Glands: The right adrenal gland is mildly thickened, without a discrete lesion. Extending off the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland, there is a 1.7 cm nodule which demonstrates loss of signal on out of phase imaging, compatible with an adenoma (05:19, 10:16).  Kidneys: Bilateral kidneys are normal in size and signal intensity with no hydronephrosis or concerning lesions. Bilateral renal cysts are noted, including the dominant cyst on the left, extending off the lower pole, measuring 5.6 cm (04:22).  Gastrointestinal Tract: Small bowel loops in the midabdomen are mildly prominent, however there is no evidence of bowel obstruction. There is a trace amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  Lymph Nodes: No mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy is appreciated.  Vasculature: The abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.  Osseous and Soft Tissue Structures: T2 hyperintense lesion in the L1 vertebral body (04:29), is indicative of an intraosseous hemangioma. No concerning osseous lesions are seen.  NOTIFICATION: The findings were discussed with Dr. ___. by ___ ___, M.D. on the telephone on ___ at 1:41 ___, 5 minutes after discovery of the findings."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of epigastric pain radiating to the back, along with elevated lipase and abnormal liver function tests, initially raised suspicion for cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or other potential diagnoses. The initial ultrasound was inconclusive. The MRCP provides crucial information, revealing a mildly distended gallbladder with a large stone, circumferential gallbladder wall edema, and focal fundal adenomyomatosis. These findings strongly support the diagnosis of cholecystitis.  Importantly, the MRCP also demonstrates a normal pancreas and pancreatic duct, effectively ruling out pancreatitis as the primary cause of the patient's elevated lipase. The incidental findings of side-branch IPMNs, adrenal adenoma, renal cysts, and a vertebral hemangioma are noted but not directly relevant to the patient's acute presentation. The elevated WBC and abnormal UA suggest a possible infection, likely related to the cholecystitis. The patient's history of CAD, DM, HTN, and previous CABG are important considerations for overall management but do not alter the primary diagnosis. The MRCP findings, combined with the clinical picture and laboratory results, provide sufficient information for diagnosis and management.
