HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Healthy ___ year-old gentleman presents with 24 hrs RLQ pain.  Pain began suddenly at midnight last night.  No  associated nausea or vomiting. He does have decreased appetite. His BMs  have been regular.  No fevers or chills. Pain became more progressive and more localized to RLQ as the day went on.  He has never had an episode of pain like this before.  ROS is otherwise negative.    Past Medical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is presenting with acute, progressive RLQ pain with decreased appetite, concerning for appendicitis.  Given the location and progression of the pain, it's crucial to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness to better localize the pain and determine the severity.  Knowing the patient's age is important for risk stratification, as appendicitis is more common in younger individuals.  Additionally, social history details, specifically smoking status, can influence the risk of certain differential diagnoses.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation including McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, obturator sign, psoas sign), rectal exam

ToolMessage:
"Exam: T 98.8, HR 72, BP 126/72, RR 14, 100% RA GEN: NAD, A&O x 3 LUNGS: Clear B/L CV: RRR, nl S1 and S2 ABD: Soft, TTP in RLQ, ND, no rebound, no guarding, no hernias, positive Rosving's sign, positive psoas sign EXT: no clubbing or edema"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute RLQ pain, decreased appetite, and positive Rovsing's and psoas signs on exam, highly suggestive of appendicitis.  The patient's vital signs are stable and within normal limits.  While the physical exam findings strongly point towards appendicitis, imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of RLQ pain, such as a cecal diverticulitis.  Knowing the patient's white blood cell count will also help assess for the presence of infection.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential

ToolMessage:
"Here are the CBC with differential results from the available laboratory tests:  Complete Blood Count (CBC): - White Blood Cells: 12.0 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 4.77 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 14.3 g/dL - Hematocrit: 41.5 % - MCV: 87.0 fL - MCH: 29.9 pg - MCHC: 34.4 % - RDW: 12.8 % - Platelet Count: 263.0 K/uL  Differential: - Neutrophils: 78.1 % - Lymphocytes: 15.1 % - Monocytes: 4.9 % - Eosinophils: 1.5 % - Basophils: 0.5 %  All components of the CBC with differential are available in the laboratory results."

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute RLQ pain, positive Rovsing's and psoas signs, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and localized tenderness are highly suggestive of acute appendicitis.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast would be beneficial to confirm the diagnosis and assess for any complications, such as perforation or abscess formation.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast matches the available imaging study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial imaging was performed through the abdomen and pelvis after administration of 130 mL of IV Optiray. Multiplanar reformatted images were then obtained. No oral contrast was administered.  CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Minimal dependent atelectatic changes are noted in the visualized lung bases. No pleural or pericardial effusion is seen. There is a small hiatal hernia. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, left kidney, both ureters appear normal. Tiny 3 mm hypodensity in the lower pole of the right kidney is too small to accurately characterize but likely represent a tiny cyst. The non-opacified stomach, small bowel, and colon appear unremarkable. No free air or free fluid is noted within the abdomen. No lymph node enlargement is seen meeting CT size criteria for adenopathy. The abdominal aorta maintains a normal caliber.  CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: In the right lower quadrant, there is evidence for ____, with an appendicolith located at the neck of the appendix and with dilation of the appendix to 14 mm. There is periappendiceal stranding, with prominent adjacent 8-mm lymph node. No drainable fluid collection or free air is seen within the pelvis. The terminal ileum which loops around the abnormal appendix appears normal. The urinary bladder appears normal. The prostate contains coarse calcifications. Note is made of calcification along the vas deferens, a finding which can be seen in diabetic patients. The non-opacified rectosigmoid colon and pelvic loops of small bowel otherwise also appear normal.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes are noted along the lower thoracic spine. Note is also made of lumbarization of S1 with bilateral pseudoarthrosis of the L5 transverse processes with S1."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with acute RLQ pain, tenderness at McBurney's point, positive Rovsing's and psoas signs, leukocytosis, and the CT findings of a dilated appendix with an appendicolith, periappendiceal stranding, and an enlarged adjacent lymph node confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The absence of free air or fluid suggests that the appendix is not perforated.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with acute RLQ pain, anorexia, positive Rovsing's and psoas signs, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and the CT findings of a dilated appendix with an appendicolith, periappendiceal stranding, and an enlarged adjacent lymph node definitively confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The absence of free air or fluid suggests that the appendix is not perforated.  Given the patient's stable condition and the imaging findings, a laparoscopic appendectomy is the recommended treatment.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Cecal Diverticulitis
3. Epiploic Appendagitis
4. Mesenteric Adenitis
5. Right ureteral calculus

Treatment: Laparoscopic appendectomy.  Preoperatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole).  Postoperatively, the patient should receive pain management, continue antibiotics until afebrile and tolerating a regular diet, and have their surgical wound monitored for signs of infection.  The patient should be advised to avoid strenuous activity for several weeks following surgery.
