HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ M began experiencing right lower quadrant pain on the evening of ___. During the subsequent four days, the pain  has increased in severity and extended into the right upper  quadrant, ___. Patient reports nausea but no vomiting and a temperature of 101.2F. The pain occasionally radiates to his back. He  reports that he has eaten and has passed gas today and had a bowel movement this morning.    Past Medical History: Significant for depression, hyperlipidemia, and multiple diverticula found on colonoscopy in ___ after a year of  episodes of diarrhea, but no diverticulitis    Social History: ___ Family History: Significant for diverticulitis in his father and brother. Also significant for heart disease.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right lower quadrant pain that has migrated to the right upper quadrant, fever, nausea, and back pain. These symptoms could indicate appendicitis, cholecystitis, or potentially other diagnoses like pyelonephritis or pancreatitis.  Given the patient's history of diverticula, diverticulitis is also a possibility. I need to gather more information to differentiate between these possibilities.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Murphy's sign, costovertebral angle tenderness, assessment for rebound tenderness and guarding

ToolMessage:
"Gen- NAD, A&Ox3, no jaundice cardiac: RRR respiratory: normal breath sounds Abdomen: bowel sounds present, appropriately tender ___- warm, no edema"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's tenderness in the right lower quadrant, along with fever and nausea, still points towards appendicitis.  The absence of jaundice and the presence of bowel sounds argue against cholecystitis.  While the patient has a history of diverticula, the migration of pain from RLQ to RUQ is less typical for diverticulitis.  The report does not mention costovertebral angle tenderness, making pyelonephritis less likely.  To further differentiate, I will order lab tests to look for signs of infection and inflammation, and imaging to visualize the appendix.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, lipase, urinalysis

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift (increased neutrophils), which suggests an inflammatory process consistent with appendicitis. The normal lipase, ALT/AST, and bilirubin make pancreatitis and cholecystitis less likely.  The urinalysis is largely unremarkable, though the presence of bacteria and mucous could indicate a urinary tract infection, but the lack of other urinary symptoms makes this less probable.  An abdominal CT scan is now indicated to visualize the appendix and confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast is available. Here is the full report:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT): CT OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: Multidetector scanning is performed from the diaphragm through the symphysis during dynamic injection of 100 cc of Optiray. No prior studies are available for comparison.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: There is some atelectasis at the lung bases. There is a 3.0-cm septated hypodense lesion in segment IV of the liver which is likely consistent with a septated cyst. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands and right kidney are unremarkable. In the left kidney at mid pole, there is a 0.9-cm hypodense lesion that is too small to characterize but likely represents a simple cyst. There is no retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The small bowel is unremarkable.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: In the right lower quadrant, there is a thickened appendix measuring 8 mm with surrounding fat stranding. There is some mild thickening of the cecal wall at the appendiceal orifice. Oral contrast is seen in the cecum; however, not in the appendix which does also not contain air. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. Multiple diverticula are noted in the sigmoid colon and there is no evidence for diverticulitis. There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy. On bone windows, there are no concerning osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesions."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of appendicitis, showing a thickened appendix measuring 8mm with surrounding fat stranding and lack of luminal contrast or air. The absence of free fluid suggests that the appendix has not yet ruptured. The findings also rule out diverticulitis. The liver and kidney cysts are incidental findings.  I have enough information to recommend a surgical consult for an appendectomy.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
