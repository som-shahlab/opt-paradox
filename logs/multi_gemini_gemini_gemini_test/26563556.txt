HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ year old gentleman with abdominal pain for 2 days duration. Pain was in the right side. Much worse yesterday. Pain worse on any kind of movement.  No nausea or vomiting. Decreased appetite since last night. No fever. No urinary symptoms.    Past Medical History: None except seasonal allergies    Social History: ___ Family History: non contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: I need the patient's age to assess their risk for various conditions.  I also need more information about the location and character of the abdominal pain to narrow down the differential diagnosis. The patient's social history is incomplete, and I need to know if they smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs.  Knowing their occupation could also be helpful.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation; Abdominal exam, including inspection, auscultation, percussion, and palpation;  Assessment for Murphy's sign, McBurney's point tenderness, and Rovsing's sign.

ToolMessage:
"97.8 110 138/96 18 100%    GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, Tender right side of abdomen, with some guarding,  no palpable masses Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is experiencing right-sided abdominal pain worsened by movement, with decreased appetite and guarding on exam.  While vital signs are stable and there's no fever, the localized tenderness raises concern for appendicitis.  The absence of nausea and vomiting doesn't rule it out.  Given the patient's symptoms and exam findings, I need to rule out appendicitis and other potential causes of right-sided abdominal pain.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, Urinalysis, Lipase

ToolMessage:
"I'll help you organize the available results for the requested tests:  CBC with differential: - White Blood Cells: 8.9 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 4.88 m/uL - Hemoglobin: 14.4 g/dL - Hematocrit: 43.1% - MCV: 88.0 fL - MCH: 29.5 pg - MCHC: 33.4% - RDW: 13.5% - Platelet Count: 237.0 K/uL - Neutrophils: 69.9% - Lymphocytes: 21.4% - Monocytes: 3.2% - Eosinophils: 4.7% - Basophils: 0.7%  CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel): - Sodium: 138.0 mEq/L - Potassium: 4.5 mEq/L - Chloride: 100.0 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 28.0 mEq/L - Creatinine: 1.0 mg/dL - Urea Nitrogen: 13.0 mg/dL - Glucose: Negative - Anion Gap: 15.0 mEq/L  Urinalysis: - Appearance: Clear - Color: Straw - Specific Gravity: 1.011 - pH: 7.0 units - Protein: Negative - Glucose: Negative - Ketones: Negative - Blood: Negative - Nitrite: Negative - Leukocytes: Negative - Bilirubin: Negative - Urobilinogen: Negative  Lipase: This test result is not available in the provided data."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right-sided abdominal pain, worse with movement, decreased appetite, and guarding.  Vital signs are stable, and lab results, including CBC, CMP, and urinalysis, are normal.  While the lipase result is missing, the clinical picture is highly suspicious for appendicitis.  An abdominal CT scan is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: ___ MDCT-acquired axial images from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis were displayed with 5-mm slice thickness. Oral and intravenous contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were prepared.  CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear. There is no focal consolidation, nodule, or pleural effusion. The visualized heart and great vessels are unremarkable. There is homogenous enhancement of the liver parenchyma without focal lesion. No intra- or extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. The hepatic veins and portal venous system are grossly patent. The gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are within normal limits. There is symmetric enhancement and excretion of the kidneys without focal lesion or hydronephrosis. The abdominal aorta and its branch vessels are grossly patent and non-aneurysmal. There is no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes. There is no free fluid or free air. In the right lower quadrant, there is a 12-mm blind-ending, fluid-filled tubular structure with adjacent fat stranding, findings concerning for acute ____. No extraluminal air or adjacent free fluid is identified. The remainder of the stomach and small bowel are normal in caliber and configuration without evidence of obstruction.  CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum and colon are normal in caliber and configuration without evidence of obstruction. The prostate, seminal vesicles, and bladder are normal. There is a small amount of pelvic free fluid. No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are identified.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No bone destructive lesion or fracture is identified."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a ___-year-old male with a 2-day history of right-sided abdominal pain, worse with movement, and decreased appetite. Physical exam revealed localized tenderness with guarding.  Vital signs and laboratory tests (CBC, CMP, urinalysis) were normal.  The CT scan demonstrates a 12 mm blind-ending, fluid-filled tubular structure in the right lower quadrant with adjacent fat stranding, highly suggestive of acute appendicitis. The small amount of pelvic free fluid is likely reactive.  The overall clinical picture, combined with the CT findings, confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

5. Cecal Diverticulitis

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy.  Given the CT findings suggestive of acute appendicitis without perforation, a laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred approach.
