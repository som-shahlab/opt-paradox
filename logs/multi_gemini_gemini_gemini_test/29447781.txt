HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ otherwise healthy presents with RLQ abdominal pain that  began yesterday at 2 pm. He reports associated nausea and vomiting. Initially he had some loose, non-bloody stool but that has since resolved. Pain was initially diffuse, but migrated to the RLQ. Pain slightly alleviated by bending knees and pain medication, but otherwise constant. Temperature of 100 prior to arrival with chills since last night.    Past Medical History: PMH: -none   PSH:  -sinus surgery -Left wrist surgery -no abdominal operations   Social History: ___ Family History: No family history of IBD or GI malignancy.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.  The migration of pain from diffuse to RLQ, along with fever and chills, raises suspicion for appendicitis.  However, other diagnoses such as mesenteric adenitis, ovarian torsion (if female), or a kidney stone need to be ruled out. A physical exam is necessary to evaluate for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam to assess for tenderness, guarding, rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate

ToolMessage:
"Admission   Vitals-WNL GEN: uncomfortable appearing but in NAD HEENT: EOMI, MMM, no scleral icterus CV: RRR PULM: non-labored breathing, room air ABD: soft, non-distended, exquisistely TTP in RLQ over  McBurney's point with voluntary guarding, +Rovsing sign, +psoas sign, negative obturator, no rebound, no masses, no hernias EXT: no edema, WWP NEURO: A&Ox3 PSYCH: appropriate mood, appropriate affect"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. The migration of pain from diffuse to RLQ, along with fever, chills, and positive Rovsing's and Psoas signs on physical exam, strongly suggests appendicitis.  While other diagnoses are still possible, the clinical picture is highly suspicious for appendicitis.  A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast would help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 5.5 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 26.5 mGy (Body) DLP = 13.2 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 4.8 s, 52.9 cm; CTDIvol = 10.9 mGy (Body) DLP = 574.4 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 588 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. Subcentimeter cortical hypodensities bilaterally are too small to characterize, however likely represent cysts. There is no hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is fluid-filled and dilated up to 1.3 cm with mild wall hyperemia and surrounding fat stranding (2:61, 601:20). There is a 1.0 x 0.8 cm appendicolith at the base of the appendix, and a tiny appendicolith in the distal appendix (601:23, 21). There is no extraluminal air or fluid collection.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is trace free fluid in the pelvis, likely reactive.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: A 1.2 cm cystic lesion in the midline of the prostate is consistent with a prostatic utricle cyst.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and migration of pain, combined with positive Rovsing's and Psoas signs on physical exam, strongly suggested appendicitis. The CT scan confirms the diagnosis, showing a dilated appendix with wall hyperemia, surrounding fat stranding, and appendicoliths.  The presence of appendicoliths further strengthens the diagnosis of appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Kidney Stone
4. Ovarian Torsion (if female)
5. Constipation

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy. This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the surgeon's preference and the patient's condition.  Pre-operatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids, antibiotics (e.g., cefazolin, metronidazole), and pain medication.
