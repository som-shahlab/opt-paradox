HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ otherwise healthy presents with abdominal pain since 9PM last night (___). He reports that it has been worsening  throughout the night. + nausea/vomiting x1, denies fever/chills, denies changes in bowels. Has never experienced pain like this before. No history of IBD or intestinal problems.    Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain of unknown etiology. Given the worsening pain, nausea/vomiting, and lack of fever/chills, several differential diagnoses are possible, including appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or bowel obstruction. A physical exam is necessary to assess for peritoneal signs and localize the pain.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Complete abdominal exam, vital signs including temperature,  assess for rebound tenderness, guarding, rigidity, Murphy's sign, McBurney's point tenderness

ToolMessage:
"Admission  Vitals: 98.6, 84, 101/61, 16, 100% RA GEN: A&O, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, TTP in RLQ, no rebound or guarding Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and right lower quadrant tenderness.  The absence of fever, rebound tenderness, and guarding argues against a classic presentation of acute appendicitis, but it cannot be ruled out.  The lack of scleral icterus and Murphy's sign makes cholecystitis less likely.  Given the location of the pain, and to further evaluate for appendicitis, imaging is warranted.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the full report for \"CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST\":  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Acquisition sequence: 1) Stationary Acquisition 5.5 s, 0.5 cm; CTDIvol = 26.5 mGy (Body) DLP = 13.2 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 4.8 s, 52.0 cm; CTDIvol = 8.0 mGy (Body) DLP = 416.9 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 430 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: There is a small hiatal hernia. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. There is an inflamed and enlarged appendix, measuring up to 8 mm with adjacent fat stranding and reactive mesenteric lymph nodes (series 601b: Image 22). A small appendicalith is noted within the appendix. There is no evidence of perforation or abscess formation.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The visualized reproductive organs are unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis, demonstrating an inflamed and enlarged appendix with an appendicolith, periappendiceal fat stranding, and reactive mesenteric lymph nodes.  There is no evidence of perforation or abscess formation.  This information is sufficient to guide treatment.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of acute abdominal pain with RLQ tenderness, along with the CT findings of an inflamed and enlarged appendix with an appendicolith, confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The absence of fever, rebound tenderness, and guarding suggests that it is early in its course, but the presence of fat stranding and reactive mesenteric lymph nodes indicates inflammation.  Surgical intervention is warranted.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Early Bowel Obstruction
3. Mesenteric Adenitis
4. Right Lower Lobe Pneumonia (atypical presentation)
5. Ovarian Cyst (if female)

Treatment:  Appendectomy is indicated.  This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on surgeon preference and patient factors.  Pre-operative antibiotics should be administered to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole).  Post-operative care should include pain management, monitoring for complications (e.g., infection, abscess), and early ambulation.  The patient should be kept NPO until bowel function returns.
