HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ M with h/o anxiety and peptic ulcer disease, who presented  with RUQ pain. He was in his USOH until yesterday night ~ 8 ___  when he began noticing R-sided abd pain. The pain was not too  concerning, rated ___ and felt similar to indigestion. He  took pepto bismol and was able to sleep.  . ___ morning, he woke up with much more pain which quickly  worsened throughout the day. Pain radiated to his R mid-lower  back and his upper R chest. He rates the pain ___ at its worst  and it became constant and severe. It was associated with nausea  but no vomiting. Unable to associate certain actions that made  it better or worse. Described trying to eat pasta at 1pm and  being in too much pain to do so, but does not believe the act of  eating contributed to pain. By 2pm, pain too severe, "like  getting punched in the stomach constantly", and presented to ED  for evaluation. . Of note, pt endorses significant chronic EtOH use with increased  amounts this past weekend. In general, ~15 drinks/week with ___  shots of whiskey a few nights/week. This weekend his friends are  in town and reports 3 beers on both ___ and ___, and 6  beers on ___. Also admits to doing 2 lines of cocaine a few  days ago but stopping because of chest pain. Last drink was 6pm  on ___.  In the ED, initial vitals were 97.7 61 131/78 16 99% on RA. Labs  showed nl chemistry, elevated lipase to 484, and otherwise  normal LFTs. WBC was 6.4 w/ 79% PMNs. RUQ U/S was normal. He  received 30 mg IV toradol, 4 mg IV morphine and 2L IVF. Pain was  well-controlled, and pt found toradol especially helpful.   On admission to the floor, patient appeared well with pain in  control, denying nausea.      Past Medical History: 1. Anxiety - ___ since taking medication for this 2. Peptic ulcer - date unknown 3. OSA - recommended to have CPAP, does not use 4. Cocaine use - used regularly a few years ago (few  times/month) but stopped ___ chest pain + recent use 3d ago 5. EtOH abuse - denies any binging, but just constant consistent  high daily/weekly amounts       Social History: ___ Family History: - Negative for early coronary artery disease, prostate and colon  cancer.  - Positive for chronic lung disease, breast CA and alcoholism.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RUQ pain, initially mild and similar to indigestion, which progressively worsened, radiating to the right mid-lower back and upper right chest.  The patient has a history of anxiety, peptic ulcer disease, OSA, cocaine use, and significant chronic EtOH use, with increased consumption over the recent weekend. Initial labs showed normal chemistry and LFTs, but elevated lipase, suggesting pancreatitis. However, a normal RUQ ultrasound raises the need to investigate other potential causes or complications. The patient's history of cocaine use and chest pain also warrants further investigation.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation and elevated lipase strongly suggest pancreatitis. While the RUQ ultrasound was normal, it is not uncommon for early ultrasound findings to be negative in pancreatitis.  Given the patient's history of recent cocaine use and chest pain, it's crucial to rule out cardiac involvement. Additionally, amylase, CRP, and a urine toxicology screen would be helpful to further evaluate the pancreatitis and potential contributing factors. An EKG is necessary to assess for any cardiac abnormalities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, elevated lipase, normal LFTs, and lack of findings on RUQ ultrasound are consistent with acute pancreatitis.  Although amylase, CRP, urine toxicology, and EKG were not available, the clinical picture strongly suggests pancreatitis as the primary diagnosis.  The patient's history of chronic alcohol abuse and recent increased consumption likely contributed to the current episode.  While cocaine use and chest pain warrant consideration, the absence of cardiac symptoms and normal initial labs make significant cardiac involvement less likely.  Further management should focus on supportive care for pancreatitis.
