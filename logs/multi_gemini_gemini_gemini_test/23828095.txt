Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This is a ___ year old male with a history of a tramatic pancreas  injury in ___ who presents with vomiting and epigastric pain x  1 day. He consumed ~8 beers last night and vomitted 3 times. No  hematemesis. This AM he woke with constant epigastric pain,  nonradiating. He tried crackers and vomited. He also had loose,  nonbloody stools x 1. The pain is ___, worse with talking and  inspiration and food.     Past Medical History: Pancreatic laceration ___ from ___ - managed  conservatively with TPN and bowel rest. asthma, GERD, ___ syndrome, depression,  polysubstance abuse, hx EtOH abuse, binge drinker, Hx IVDU and  rx opiate use-sober x14mos   PSH: tonsillectomy, adnoidectomy, b/l ear tubes, L hernia repair       Social History: ___ Family History: CAD father's side, CABG at ___


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's history of pancreatic trauma raises concern for pancreatic complications.  The recent alcohol consumption and vomiting could exacerbate or mimic pancreatic issues.  Given the epigastric pain, vomiting, and history, it's crucial to evaluate for pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, or other related complications. I need to assess the severity of the pain and look for signs of peritonitis. Lab tests are necessary to evaluate pancreatic function and look for inflammation.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with concerning symptoms, including vomiting and epigastric pain, in the context of a past pancreatic injury. While the lipase and amylase are within normal limits, making acute pancreatitis less likely, the patient's history and symptoms warrant further investigation to rule out other pancreatic or gastrointestinal complications. The slightly elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia suggests a possible inflammatory process, though it's nonspecific.  An abdominal CT scan would be helpful to visualize the pancreas and surrounding structures, looking for any signs of inflammation, fluid collections, or other abnormalities.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"While there is a CT Abdomen and Pelvis study available in the records, it was performed with and without contrast (dual phase), rather than just with contrast as requested. The closest matching study is:  CT ABD W&W/O C:  TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen and pelvis following administration of oral and intravenous contrast material. Multiplanar reformatted images were also obtained. Pre-contrast images were also obtained.  CT ABDOMEN WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: At the lung bases, the lungs are clear without pleural effusion or consolidation. The heart is normal in size, without pericardial effusion. In the abdomen, the body of the pancreas is swollen, indistinct, and surrounded by mesenteric fat stranding. However, the pancreas enhances symmetrically, without evidence of necrosis. No pancreatic duct dilatation or pancreatic calcification noted. Adjacent vasculature is patent with no evidence of pseudoaneurysm. There is no focal fluid collection. The previous large pancreatic pseudocyst has completely resolved. There is no pancreatic or intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The liver, gallbladder, adrenal glands, spleen, stomach and duodenum are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically, without hydronephrosis or stones. There is no free fluid in the abdomen. Scattered mesenteric lymph nodes adjacent to the pancreas do not meet CT criteria for pathologic enlargement.  CT PELVIS WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST: The large and small bowel are unremarkable. The urinary bladder, distal ureters, and prostate gland are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no fracture or worrisome lytic or sclerotic bony lesion. Soft tissues are unremarkable."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's history of pancreatic trauma, current symptoms of vomiting and epigastric pain, along with the CT findings of a swollen pancreas with surrounding fat stranding, suggest a diagnosis of pancreatitis, likely related to his recent alcohol consumption.  Although his lipase and amylase are normal, imaging findings support the diagnosis. The resolution of the previous pseudocyst is noted.  No other concerning findings are present on the CT scan.  I have enough information to make a diagnosis.
