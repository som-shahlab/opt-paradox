Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
HISTORY OF PRESENTING ILLNESS   ___ Yo F who presents with L flank and abdominal pain. Pain started yesterday, initially colicky in nature, in the lower L back, radiating around to abdomen, but since being in the ED, she notes pain is more diffuse, anterior, radiating up to upper abdomen. She notes nausea and vomiting. She denies being able to find a comfortable position, describes pain as sharp, shooting, unlike anything she has experienced before. No fevers, chills. No diarrhea. Pain ___.                        Timing: Gradual                      Severity: ___                                ___                      Duration: Days                      Location: lower abdominal pain     Associated Signs/Symptoms: nausea, chills, vomiting    Past Medical History:  Notable for bilateral femoral enchondromas.  She had a resection of one in her right femur by Dr. ___ had a plate put in place, which was removed a  year later when it became symptomatic.  Otherwise, she has just been following the enchondromas over time and they have not caused  her any problems.  She recently had a varicose vein removal from her left leg.  Also she was recently seen in the emergency  department following her MRI with contrast with headache and some facial numbness that resolved and they were attributed to possible reaction to the contrast.  Otherwise, review of systems is negative.  Her past medical history is otherwise negative including no hypertension, diabetes, heart problems, lung problems, or other issues.    Social History: ___ Family History:  Notable for mother with pulmonary hypertension but otherwise negative.  No history of bone tumors or soft  tissue masses.

Thought: The patient presents with left flank and abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The pain is severe, sharp, and shooting, radiating from the lower left back to the upper abdomen.  The patient has a history of bilateral femoral enchondromas and recent varicose vein removal.  Given the location and nature of the pain, along with associated symptoms, several diagnoses are possible, including kidney stones, pyelonephritis, ovarian torsion, or other abdominal pathology.  Further information is needed to narrow down the differential diagnosis.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with left flank and abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  The pain is severe, sharp, and shooting, radiating from the lower left back to the upper abdomen. The urinalysis shows hazy appearance, glucose and ketones are high, and there are a few RBCs. The CBC shows slightly elevated neutrophils. The rest of the labs are normal.  The patient has a history of bilateral femoral enchondromas. While the lab results don't definitively point to a specific diagnosis, the presence of glucose and ketones in the urine along with flank pain raises suspicion for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), especially given the elevated neutrophils and patient's report of nausea and vomiting.  However, the lack of significantly elevated glucose in the blood is not typical for DKA.  The RBCs in urine and flank pain could also suggest kidney stones. An abdominal CT scan is needed to evaluate for kidney stones and other potential causes of abdominal pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis without contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT Abdomen and Pelvis without contrast is not available in the provided list. The only available study is a CTU (ABD/PEL) W/&W/O CONTRAST, which includes both non-contrast and contrast phases."

The RBCs in urine and flank pain could suggest kidney stones.  A CT Abdomen and Pelvis with and without contrast is the available imaging study, and while contrast is not ideal in some situations, it can be helpful in evaluating the kidneys and other abdominal structures.  Given the patient's recent contrast reaction, the benefits of obtaining a complete study outweigh the risks in this case as it will help differentiate between kidney stones, pyelonephritis, and other potential causes of abdominal pain.
