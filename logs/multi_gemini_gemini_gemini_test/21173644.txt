HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ previously healthy presents with 2 wks abdominal pain,  crampy/achy in nature.  Has been constant.  Worse with  urination/straining/moving around at martial arts class.  Better with lying still.  Has experienced nausea, no emesis, anorexia,  and fatigue.  Having loose BMs and some constipation,  alternating, and was previously very regular with formed stools.   Patient talked with gynecologist about her pain, who thought it  might be ovulation-related.  Ms. ___ recalls feeling some  shaking chills earlier today, no fevers.  Has some trouble  sleeping at baseline.    Past Medical History: Past Medical History: insomnia, hospitalized for RSV as infant  Past Surgical History: none   Social History: ___ Family History: no family h/o IBD or CRC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, and fatigue. These symptoms could indicate a range of gastrointestinal issues, including infection, inflammatory bowel disease, or irritable bowel syndrome. The worsening of pain with movement and urination suggests possible involvement of the urinary tract or peritoneum. The recent chills raise concern for an infectious process.  To differentiate between these possibilities, I need further information.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show leukocytosis and mild anemia.  The urinalysis shows some ketones and a few RBCs and WBCs, which could suggest a mild urinary tract infection or dehydration.  The lack of fever and the normal CRP and ESR argue against a systemic infection. Given the abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and now the mild anemia, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains a concern. I would like to visualize the bowel to assess for inflammation or other abnormalities.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the requested CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was not administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 749 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. Wall thickening and hyperenhancement of the appendiceal base which is dilated to approximately 16 mm with an appendicolith. Distally, the appendix is poorly defined and there is significant surrounding inflammatory change. Regions of peripheral enhancement with central low density measuring overall approximately 4.0 x2.7 cm without large discrete low-density component. There is no visualized extraluminal/free intraperitoneal air.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The uterus is of normal size and enhancement. A 3.2 x 2.1 cm right adnexal cyst is seen. No at left adnexal mass lesions identified.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. No atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's key symptoms include abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, fatigue, and chills.  Lab results revealed leukocytosis and mild anemia.  The CT scan reveals appendicitis with a dilated appendiceal base, appendicolith, and surrounding inflammatory changes. The findings on CT are consistent with the patient's symptoms and explain the leukocytosis.  The right adnexal cyst is likely incidental and not the cause of her current symptoms.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, nausea, anorexia, and fatigue, along with leukocytosis and mild anemia, initially raised suspicion for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the CT scan reveals appendicitis with a dilated appendix, appendicolith, and surrounding inflammatory changes. This explains her symptoms and the lab findings. The right adnexal cyst is likely incidental and not contributing to her current symptoms.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Urinary Tract Infection (possible, but less likely given the CT findings)
3. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (less likely given the CT findings)
4. Ovarian Cyst (incidental finding)
5. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (less likely given the CT findings and leukocytosis)

Treatment:  Appendectomy is indicated given the CT findings suggestive of acute appendicitis.  This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the surgeon's preference and the patient's condition.  Preoperative antibiotics should be administered to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.  Postoperative care should include pain management, monitoring for complications such as infection or abscess formation, and ensuring adequate hydration and nutrition.  The patient should be advised to avoid strenuous activity for several weeks following surgery.  The incidental ovarian cyst should be monitored with repeat imaging in 6-12 weeks.
