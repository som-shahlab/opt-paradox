Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, jaundice, and dark red urine, concerning for biliary obstruction or liver dysfunction.  Given his history of colectomy and anastomotic stricture, it's important to rule out complications related to these prior surgeries. The elevated total bilirubin with a prior history of indirect hyperbilirubinemia requires further investigation. I need to understand the location and nature of the abdominal pain, the characteristics of the dark red urine, and the findings on the CT scan mentioned in the history.  Additionally, lab tests are needed to assess liver function, biliary obstruction, and potential causes of the patient's symptoms.

Thought: The patient's lab results show a predominantly indirect hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and urine ketones. The normal liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and GGT suggest that the jaundice is not due to hepatocellular injury or biliary obstruction. The elevated BUN and urine specific gravity suggest dehydration.  The urine ketones may be related to dehydration or poor oral intake. The anemia could be chronic or related to acute blood loss, though there is no history suggestive of the latter. Given the history of prior colectomy and anastomotic stricture, I need to review the CT scan to evaluate for potential complications related to the prior surgery, such as obstruction or ischemia.

Since a CT with IV contrast is not available, I will review the available imaging studies, the liver/gallbladder ultrasound and MRCP, to evaluate for biliary and liver pathology.  If these studies are unrevealing, I will consider Gilbert's syndrome as a potential cause of the indirect hyperbilirubinemia.

The liver/gallbladder ultrasound shows gallstones and sludge, but no biliary dilation, making biliary obstruction less likely.  The MRCP results are still needed to fully evaluate the biliary tree.  Given the patient's history of prior abdominal surgeries and current symptoms, I will also request a physical exam to assess for any abdominal tenderness, masses, or other abnormalities.

Thought: The patient presents with abdominal pain, jaundice, and dark red urine. Lab results reveal predominantly indirect hyperbilirubinemia, anemia, and urine ketones. Liver enzymes, alkaline phosphatase, and GGT are normal, suggesting the jaundice is not due to hepatocellular injury or biliary obstruction. Elevated BUN and urine specific gravity indicate dehydration, which may also explain the urine ketones. The anemia could be chronic or due to acute blood loss, though the latter is less likely given the absence of suggestive history. The liver/gallbladder ultrasound shows gallstones and sludge but no biliary dilation, making obstruction less probable. The physical exam reveals tenderness in the LUQ, epigastrium, and most prominently in the RUQ, along with hyperactive bowel sounds.  While the ultrasound did not show biliary dilation, the patient's RUQ pain, jaundice, and history of gallstones raise the possibility of biliary dyskinesia or other gallbladder pathology. The lack of biliary dilation on ultrasound does not definitively rule out these possibilities.  The patient's history of colectomy and anastomotic stricture also warrants consideration, although the location of pain and lack of distention or other concerning findings on exam make obstruction less likely. The anemia requires further investigation, and the possibility of Gilbert's syndrome should be considered given the predominantly indirect hyperbilirubinemia and lack of other liver abnormalities.  Given the available information, I believe I have enough information to provide a differential diagnosis and recommend a treatment plan.
