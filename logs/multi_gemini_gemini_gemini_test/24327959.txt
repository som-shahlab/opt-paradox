HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ presents w/ abdominal pain since ___ yesterday afternoon.  He says the pain began as periumbilical/epigastric pain that migrated to the right lower quadrant and intensified  as the day progressed.  He endorses some anorexia.  He denies nausea/vomiting/fevers/chills/BRBPR/melena/change in bowel habits.    In the ED the patient has a low grade temperature to 100.2, VSS, is TTP in the RLQ, has a WBC of 12.7 and has a CT scan showing a 7mm appendix that does not fill with contrast.    Past Medical History: None.   Social History: ___ Family History: Noncontributory.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with classic symptoms of appendicitis: initial periumbilical/epigastric pain migrating to the RLQ, anorexia, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and RLQ tenderness. The CT scan finding of a non-filling appendix further supports this diagnosis. While the 7mm diameter is not definitively enlarged, the lack of contrast filling is highly suspicious.  I would like to rule out other causes of RLQ pain, specifically focusing on conditions that could mimic appendicitis.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: Urinalysis, Urine hCG

ToolMessage:
"I'll help you retrieve the urinalysis and urine hCG results.  For the Urinalysis, multiple components are available: - Appearance: Clear - Color: Yellow - Mucous: Few - Specific Gravity: 1.021 - pH: 6.0 units - Protein: Trace - Blood: Negative - Nitrite: Negative - Leukocytes: Negative - Ketones: Trace - Bilirubin: Negative - Urobilinogen: Negative - WBC: 1.0 #/hpf - RBC: 0.0 #/hpf - Epithelial Cells: 0.0 #/hpf - Bacteria: None - Yeast: None  The Urine hCG test result is not available in the provided laboratory data."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including migration of pain from periumbilical to RLQ, anorexia, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, RLQ tenderness, and a non-filling appendix on CT, strongly suggests appendicitis. The normal urinalysis results help rule out a urinary tract infection or kidney stones as the cause of the abdominal pain. Although the urine hCG result is not available, the patient's presentation is highly consistent with appendicitis.  Given the totality of the findings, I am confident in the diagnosis of appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric adenitis
3. Epiploic appendagitis

5. Early Crohn's disease (less likely given the acute presentation)

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment for acute appendicitis. This can be performed laparoscopically or via an open approach.  The patient should be given intravenous fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem, or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole).
