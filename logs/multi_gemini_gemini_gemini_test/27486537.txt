Lytes unremarkable, wbc 7,  hct 39. She was given demerol 25 mg, zofran 4 mg iv, toradol 30  mg iv, phenegan 6.25 mg, dilaudid ___s CTX 2 mg iv  x1. A CT abdomen showed severe ileitis as well as inflammation  involving her appendix and tracking subhepatically. Per report,  pt seen by surgery there and fel the pt did not have an acute  abdomen. Pt transferred to ___ by medflight for direct admit.  Dr. ___ aware. . ROS: she denies f/c/cp/sob/brbpr/bloody emesis.     Past Medical History: Crohn's disease   Social History: ___ Family History: dad with h/o colitis


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the patient's history of Crohn's and the current symptoms, it's crucial to differentiate between a Crohn's flare and other potential complications like an abscess, fistula, or appendicitis. The CT scan indicating ileitis, appendiceal inflammation, and subhepatic tracking raises concern for an intra-abdominal infection.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient has a history of Crohn's disease presenting with RLQ abdominal pain and vomiting. While her symptoms temporarily resolved, they recurred, prompting an ED visit and a CT scan showing severe ileitis, appendiceal inflammation, and subhepatic tracking. The elevated CRP suggests an inflammatory process.  The negative guaiac makes significant bleeding less likely.  Though the outside hospital felt this was not a surgical abdomen, the patient's presentation and CT findings warrant a surgical consultation to definitively rule out complications such as abscess, fistula, or appendicitis.  Anemia is present and may be chronic or related to a Crohn's flare.
