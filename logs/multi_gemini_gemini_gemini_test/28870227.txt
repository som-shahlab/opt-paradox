Patient History:
HOSPITAL MEDICINE ADMISSION NOTE  Time patient seen and examined today: 10AM  CC: OSH transfer for fluid at right hip and low grade fevers  HPI(4): Ms. ___ is a ___ female with history of  dementia, PE previously on coumadin, chronic anemia and  thrombocytopenia with suspected MDS, newly diagnosed  hypothyroidism and recent complicated admission for right hip  prosthetic joint infection status post washout currently on  course of prolonged IV abx who presents from OSH with low grade  fevers and concern for fluid around right hip joint seen on OSH  imaging.   Patient is currently completing a course of IV CTX for known  pansensitive E. coli right hip PJI due to end on ___. She is  followed by OPAT and has been residing at rehab since discharge  from ___ earlier this month. She has known fluid collection at  right hip joint site seen on most recent CT scan in our system  last month. She was admitted with right hip pain recently and  found to have deep tissue right prosthetic hip infection with  fasciitis after weeks of pain. OR cultures grew pan-sensitive E.  coli. Blood cultures negative. Patient underwent washout x2 with  wound vac placement was taken down post-op. Infection treated  initially with vancomycin and metronidazole that was  transitioned to IV ceftriaxone per ID team for 6 weeks to end on  ___ followed by possible oral suppressive therapy in the  presence of hardware. Her course was complicated by acute  encephalopathy and acute hypoxic and hypercarbic respiratory  failure from combination of central hypoventilation and volume  overload. Her Coumadin has been held in the setting of ongoing  anemia and thrombocytopenia with plan to defer decision to  restart to outpatient providers. She has a chronic indwelling  foley and previous history of recurrent UTI's. She presented  from rehab to outside hospital yesterday with right hip pain,  low grade fevers and had workup notable for stable CBC (no  leukocytosis, anemia at baseline) and CT A/P with e/o stercoral  colitis as well as fluid around right hip joint.   In our ED, Tmax was 100.8, VS otherwise stable. CBC and  chemistries noted to be at baseline. UA showed 30K whites with  ___ and bacteria. blood and urine cultures were sent. She was  manually disimpacted and treated with IV morphine x1 for severe  pain at right hip as well as suprapubic region. She was treated  with Vanc and CTX and Ortho was consulted for imaging findings  at OSH. Ortho saw patient in the ED and reviewed her imaging  findiongs but felt that her exam looked benign and her imaging  showed stable size of fluid collection compared to prior. CRP  was downtrending from prior at 30 today compared to > 100  previously. Per ortho low suspicion for acute change involving  hip or need for surgical intervention at this time.   On arrival to the floor patient endorsed persistent pain at  right hip as well as suprapubic area, though appeared  comfortable and per grand-daughter improved since receiving IV  morphine in the ED. Granddaughter noted persistent low grade  fevers that have been ongoing since recent discharge from ___.  I spoke with ___ regarding potential need for drainage of fluid,  per their review of her CT scan, the size of the fluid  collection as well as the level of inflammation in the  surrounding tissue seemed stable compared to prior. The only  difference they noted was thicker wall around the fluid  collection compared to prior.    ROS: Pertinent positives and negatives as noted in the HPI.  All  other systems were reviewed and are negative.     Past Medical History: PAST MEDICAL / SURGICAL HISTORY: Dementia DVT/PE, s/p IVC filter, previously on Coumadin (held recently) GERD Dyslipidemia Bipolar disorder Right hip fx s/p TFN, complicated by  Right hip Prosthetic Joint Infection (___), s/p: - ___ I&D with VAC placement  - ___ I&D with partial closure and VAC placement - ___ I&D with complete wound closure     Social History: ___ Family History: FAMILY HISTORY: Reviewed and found to be not relevant to this  illness/reason for hospitalization.

Thought: The patient has a history of right hip prosthetic joint infection (PJI) and presents with low-grade fevers and fluid around the right hip joint.  While orthopedics has deemed the current fluid collection stable, the patient is experiencing persistent pain.  I need to gather more information to assess the possibility of a recurrent infection or other complications.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show a high CRP, leukocyturia, and bacteriuria, which suggest a possible urinary tract infection (UTI).  Her anemia, thrombocytopenia, and low albumin are also notable and consistent with her history of MDS.  While her WBC count is within normal limits, this does not rule out infection given her other clinical findings and history of PJI.  Given the persistent pain and concerning lab results, I want to obtain additional information about the fluid collection at the right hip.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Right hip ultrasound, right hip aspiration for fluid analysis and culture

ToolMessage:
"The requested right hip ultrasound and right hip aspiration are not available among the provided imaging studies. The available studies include a pelvis/femur X-ray, bilateral upper extremity vein ultrasound, liver/gallbladder ultrasound, and a portable chest X-ray, but no hip ultrasound or aspiration reports."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs suggest a possible UTI, which could be contributing to her symptoms.  Her anemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypoalbuminemia are consistent with her history of MDS.  The lack of a right hip ultrasound and aspiration limits my ability to fully assess the fluid collection.  Given her history of PJI, persistent pain, elevated CRP, and concerning UA, I would recommend obtaining these studies to evaluate for a potential recurrent infection or other complications related to the right hip.  If the aspiration reveals purulence or positive cultures, this would strongly suggest a recurrent PJI.  If the fluid is not purulent and cultures are negative, other causes of hip pain should be considered.
