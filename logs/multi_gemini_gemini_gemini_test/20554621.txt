HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ healthy USH this AM when he suddenly experienced acute onset  of vague abdominal pain. Pain progressed throughout the day. +  chills denies fevers or diarrhea. Tried taking some laxatives  without any alleviation of pain. No appetite. + NB emesis.    Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: No IBD or colonic malginancy


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, chills, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. These symptoms could indicate a range of conditions, including appendicitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or bowel obstruction.  A physical exam is necessary to assess for peritoneal signs, tenderness, and other relevant findings.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation including McBurney's point and Murphy's sign), assessment for dehydration

ToolMessage:
"97.8 68 124/66 18 100%  In pain A+OX3 RRR CTAB Soft, diffusely tender, no peritoneal signs, + Rovsings Rectal exam deferred"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's vital signs are relatively stable, though slightly tachycardic.  Diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs raises suspicion for a non-localized process such as gastroenteritis, but other possibilities like early appendicitis or mesenteric adenitis are still possible.  The absence of fever argues against a significant infectious process, but doesn't rule it out.  Given the vomiting and lack of bowel movement, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis would be helpful to visualize the bowel and other abdominal organs.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT Abdomen and Pelvis with IV contrast report. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis after the uneventful administration of 130 ml of Omnipaque. Coronal and sagittal reformations were provided and reviewed. Oral contrast was not administered.  DOSE: DLP: 585.44 mGy-cm  FINDINGS: Abdomen: The included lung bases show no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. The imaged heart is normal size there is no pericardial effusion. The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesions. The gallbladder is normal and there is no intra or extrahepatic biliary ductal dilation. The spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys enhance symmetrically and excrete contrast without hydronephrosis. Opacified portions of the ureters are normal in course and caliber. The portal vein, splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein are patent. Scattered retroperitoneal lymph nodes do not meet criteria for pathologic enlargement. The stomach, small bowel and large bowel are normal. There is no obstruction. The appendix is dilated to 8 mm in caliber and shows mucosal hyperemia. An 11 mm appendicolith is present at the base the appendix (02:55). There is no evidence of perforation and there is no abscess.  Pelvis: The bladder, prostate and rectum are normal. There is no free pelvic fluid. There is no inguinal or pelvic sidewall lymphadenopathy.  Bones and soft tissues: There are no lytic or blastic osseous lesions of concern."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, chills, nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite.  The physical exam revealed diffuse tenderness without peritoneal signs. The CT scan shows a dilated appendix with an appendicolith and mucosal hyperemia, consistent with acute appendicitis.  While there is no evidence of perforation or abscess, the presence of an appendicolith and the patient's symptoms warrant surgical consultation.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Gastroenteritis
4. Early Bowel Obstruction
5. Constipation

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for appendectomy.  Administer IV fluids for hydration and electrolyte management.  Administer analgesics for pain control.  Administer prophylactic antibiotics, such as Cefoxitin or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole, prior to surgery.  Monitor vital signs and clinical status.  Post-operative care should include pain management, wound care, and monitoring for complications such as infection or abscess formation.
