HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with no significant PMH, who presented to ___ outpatient  clinic with periumbilical pain x1 day that moved to RLQ, now  focal and worsening.  Ambulating.  No N/V/D, last BM today,  normal.  Tolerating PO.  No prior abdominal surgeries.    Past Medical History: Uterine implant T12-L1 fusion s/p MVA ___   Social History: ___ Family History: Father died of complications from brain tumor.  Mother with  tuberculosis (treated) - otherwise healthy.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with classic symptoms of appendicitis (periumbilical pain migrating to RLQ, focal, and worsening). However, it's crucial to rule out other differential diagnoses such as ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy (if applicable), kidney stones, or diverticulitis.  A physical exam is the first step to assess for peritoneal signs and tenderness.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign), vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate)

ToolMessage:
"On admission:  T 99.4  HR 90  BP 110/60  RR 18   97%RA Gen:  laying down in bed, NAD, talking and breathing without  difficulty Neuro: A&Ox3 CV: RRR Lungs: CTAB Abd: soft, non-distended, very TTP RLQ - focal pain.  (+)  rebound, (+) Rovsing's sign and guarding.  Guaiac neg."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, fever, and positive peritoneal signs (rebound tenderness, Rovsing's sign, guarding) strongly suggests appendicitis.  The absence of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea does not rule out appendicitis.  While the patient tolerates PO intake, this also does not exclude appendicitis. The normal bowel movement is also not inconsistent with early appendicitis.  Given the concerning physical exam findings, I would proceed with imaging to confirm the diagnosis and assess for complications like perforation or abscess formation.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast matches the available CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST  STUDY: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast and reconstructions.  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axially acquired images were obtained from the lung bases to the symphysis with oral and IV contrast. Multiplanar reformatted images were obtained.  CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: There are mild hypoventilatory changes at the dependent portions of the lung bases. No focal consolidation or effusion is present. The visualized heart is grossly unremarkable without pericardial effusion. The liver, pancreas, spleen, stomach, kidneys, collecting systems, and visualized abdominal large and small bowel are unremarkable. No free fluid or free air is detected.  CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: In the inferior aspect of the cecum in the expected region of the base of the appendix there is a circular calcification measuring 1.1 cm with a second calcification superior to this measuring 1.1 cm consistent with appendicoliths. A tubular rim enhancing structure distal to this region measuring 1.8 cm is fluid filled with mild surrounding inflammatory changes in the adjacent mesenteric fat. Focal cecal wall thickening is noted surrounding the appendiceal base. No surrounding fluid collections are detected. The bowel is otherwise unremarkable without evidence of obstruction. The bladder, distal ureters, rectum and uterus are normal in appearance. There is a small cyst within the left adnexa measuring 1.9 x 1.8 cm likely physiologic. No appreciable pelvic or inguinal adenopathy is detected however paucity of intra-abdominal fat limits optimal evaluation. There is a small amount of free pelvic fluid.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No worrisome lytic or sclerotic lesions are detected. There are superior endplate depressions at T12 and L1."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT scan results confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The CT scan reveals appendicoliths, a fluid-filled tubular structure consistent with the appendix, surrounding inflammatory changes, and cecal wall thickening.  The presence of a small amount of free pelvic fluid suggests likely early perforation.  The small cyst in the left adnexa is likely an incidental finding and not the cause of the patient's symptoms. The osseous findings are consistent with her prior history of T12-L1 fusion.  I have sufficient information to recommend surgical consultation for appendectomy.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Appendicitis with possible early perforation
3. Ovarian cyst (incidental)
4. Kidney stone (ruled out by CT)
5. Diverticulitis (ruled out by CT)

Treatment:  The patient requires emergent appendectomy, preferably laparoscopic.  Pre-operative management includes IV fluids, pain control (e.g., IV morphine or hydromorphone), and prophylactic antibiotics (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of metronidazole and ceftriaxone) to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.
