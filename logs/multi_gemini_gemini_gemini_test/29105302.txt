The procedure was done under MAC and there was  unsuccessful canulation of the bile duct. A pancreatic stent was  placed to assist, but was again unsuccessful. The stent was left  in place and plan were made to have the patient return in one  week to have the PD stent removed and a repeat attempt to  canulate the CBD performed. In the interim, the patient  developed acute epigastric abd pain yesterday, with radiation to  the back, and associated nausea. She went to her local ER and  was transferred to ___.    In ER: ERCP team was called. A CT abd showed the stent in place  and no other complications. She was given cipro/flagyl and  admitted.

Thought: The patient is experiencing acute epigastric abdominal pain radiating to the back with associated nausea following an unsuccessful ERCP with pancreatic stent placement. The top differential diagnoses include post-ERCP pancreatitis, stent migration, or perforation. I need to gather more information to narrow down the cause of the patient's pain.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's significantly elevated lipase and amylase, along with the clinical picture of acute epigastric pain radiating to the back following an ERCP, strongly suggest post-ERCP pancreatitis. The elevated ALT, AST, and bilirubin are also consistent with this diagnosis and may indicate some degree of liver involvement or biliary obstruction.  The patient's anemia may be chronic given her history of lupus, but should be monitored.  No further information is needed to make this assessment.
