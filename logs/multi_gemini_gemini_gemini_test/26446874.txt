HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
HPI:  ___ last seen in ED for tooth infection on ___ and was started on penicillin at that time. She mentions similar  episodes of tooth infection in the past but they generally improved with antibiotics. She is in the process of finding ___-facial surgeon for treatment of tooth infection. Patient now presents with c/o nausea &  periumbilical pain x 2 days. The pain has not  decreased despite use of percocet & pt has not been able to take anything PO. She denies fever, chills, diarrhea, diaphoresis, pain on urination, blood in the urine, change in bowel movements     Past Medical History: PMH: ADHD, depression, vulvodynia    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with nausea and periumbilical pain for two days, unrelieved by Percocet.  While she recently had a tooth infection treated with penicillin, the current periumbilical pain suggests a different etiology.  Given the nausea, inability to tolerate PO, and lack of other GI symptoms (diarrhea, change in bowel movements), I need to rule out several possibilities, including appendicitis, small bowel obstruction, and other intra-abdominal issues. A physical exam is necessary to assess for abdominal tenderness, guarding, and other signs of peritonitis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation), vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation)

ToolMessage:
"Exam: upon admission ___  Vitals: 98.6 100 126/81 16 100% RA  GA: Alert, cooperative, knitting in bed, NAD HEENT: EOMI, MMM  CV: RRR, no m/r/g Resp: CTAB Abd: Soft, nondistended, + tap and focal rebound tenderness in RLQ, no masses, no hernias, some voluntary guarding Ext: WWP, no edema Pelvic Exam: no CMT, or ad TTP or masses"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with nausea, periumbilical pain, and inability to tolerate PO intake for two days.  She has rebound tenderness and focal tenderness in the right lower quadrant (RLQ) on physical exam, which is highly concerning for appendicitis.  While she recently had a tooth infection treated with penicillin, the current presentation is localized to the RLQ and is unlikely related to the tooth infection.  The vital signs show some tachycardia but are otherwise stable.  Given the strong suspicion for appendicitis, I would order a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for any complications like perforation or abscess.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report. Here is the complete report:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast.  TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired axial images were obtained from the lung bases to the pubic symphysis after the uneventful administration of 130 ml of Optiray and oral contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were obtained.  FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The lung bases are clear with no parenchymal consolidation or pulmonary nodules. No pleural effusions. The liver, gallbladder, spleen, both adrenal glands, both kidneys, pancreas, and visualized loops of intra-abdominal small and large bowel are unremarkable. There is no intra-abdominal free air. There is no intra-abdominal ascites. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: Located within the right lower quadrant, there is a hyperenhancing enlarged inflamed appendix measuring up to 11 mm with associated periappendiceal inflammation and fluid with findings overall compatible with ____. This can be best appreciated on (series 2: image 40) and (series 300B: image ___), and takes a posterior retrocecal approach. There is no evidence of complication with no associated periappendiceal discrete fluid collections noted, and no free air. There is no pelvic free fluid. An intrauterine device is seen within an unremarkable appearing uterus. The bilateral adnexa and bladder are unremarkable. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  BONE WINDOWS: The visualized osseous structures are unremarkable with no suspicious lytic or sclerotic foci."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with nausea, periumbilical pain, and inability to tolerate PO intake.  The physical exam revealed RLQ tenderness and rebound tenderness.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis without perforation or abscess. The appendix is enlarged, inflamed, and surrounded by periappendiceal inflammation and fluid.  The patient requires surgical intervention for appendectomy.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presented with nausea, periumbilical pain, and inability to tolerate PO intake. The physical exam revealed rebound tenderness and focal tenderness in the RLQ.  The CT scan confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis with an enlarged, inflamed appendix measuring 11mm and associated periappendiceal inflammation. There is no evidence of perforation or abscess.  The patient requires an appendectomy.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Small Bowel Obstruction
3. Mesenteric Adenitis
4. Ovarian Cyst
5. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy.  This can be performed laparoscopically or via an open procedure.  Given the lack of complications (perforation, abscess), a laparoscopic approach is preferred.  The patient should be NPO, receive IV fluids, and be given broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem) preoperatively.  Postoperatively, the patient should receive pain control, continue antibiotics as indicated, and be monitored for complications such as surgical site infection or intra-abdominal abscess.  The patient should be discharged once tolerating a regular diet, ambulating, and pain is controlled.  Follow-up with the surgical team should be arranged.
