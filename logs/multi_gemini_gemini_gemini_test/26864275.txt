HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Onset of diffuse abdominal pain and fecal urgency with malaise, gradually pain gre more sharp and localized to RLQ.  Noticed  that it was painful to stand from seated position.  Denies nausea or vomiting.  Normal appetite, normal BM today, sensation of bloating.  Denies fevers/chills.    Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: Mother passed away from mestastatic breast cancer.  Father  alive, has obesity and gout.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain migrating from diffuse to localized in the RLQ, along with fecal urgency and malaise.  This presentation suggests appendicitis.  Pain on standing suggests psoas sign which further supports this. To confirm the diagnosis, I need to perform a physical exam focusing on the abdomen.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam with focus on RLQ tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign, McBurney's point tenderness

ToolMessage:
"PE admission: 98.7 58 122/77 14 97%  Gen: AOx3 NAD Cor: RRR S1S2 Res: Normal work of breathing Abd: +TTP in RLQ,  +Rovsings, positive obturator Ext: WWP without edema"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, fecal urgency, malaise, and positive Rovsing's and obturator signs strongly suggests appendicitis. The physical exam findings of RLQ tenderness further support this diagnosis.  While not explicitly stated in the physical exam results, the pain on standing from a seated position mentioned in the HPI likely indicates a positive psoas sign, further pointing towards appendicitis. I am now confident in my assessment.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain initially diffuse then localizing to the RLQ, fecal urgency, malaise, and pain on standing (suggestive of psoas sign). These symptoms are highly suspicious for appendicitis. The physical exam findings of RLQ tenderness, positive Rovsing's sign, and positive obturator sign further strengthen the diagnosis of appendicitis.  Other diagnoses to consider in the differential include mesenteric adenitis, ovarian torsion (although less likely without nausea/vomiting), and gastroenteritis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric adenitis
3. Ovarian torsion
4. Gastroenteritis
5. Constipation

Treatment:  Surgical consultation for appendectomy is the definitive treatment.  Administer IV fluids for hydration.  Administer analgesics (e.g., morphine or hydromorphone) for pain management.  Administer antiemetics (e.g., ondansetron) if nausea or vomiting develops.  Preoperative antibiotics (e.g., cefoxitin or cefazolin plus metronidazole) should be administered.  Postoperative care includes wound care, pain management, and monitoring for complications such as infection or abscess formation.
