Patient History:
___ M with history of HTN, HL, CAD s/p CABG, Afib, DMII, presents  with acute onset of diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and  vomiting.   . Mr ___ was in usual state of health until lunch yesterday  when he developed poor appetite and nausea that worsened  throughout the day. In the evening he developed acute onset  abdominal pain in the epigastrium that radiated to his back. He  had two episodes of non bloody emesis prompting self referral to  the ED.  He denies any fevers, chills, CP, SOB, dyspnea,  diarrhea, BRBPR, melena. He endorses single episode of small of  amount his blood in his urine. . In the ED inital vitals were, 96.8 92 156/68 18 89%.  Physical  exam was notable for tender RUQ and epigastrum.  Labs showed  leukocytosis to 17.4. lipase of 4050, and elevated LFTs and  bilirubin.  CT scan showed concern for cholecystitis as it  showed distended gallbladder with multiple stones with small  foci of air in nondependent areas.

Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever, concerning for cholecystitis potentially complicated by cholangitis.  The patient's history of atrial fibrillation treated with coumadin raises concern for coagulopathy, especially given the plan for ERCP.  While some initial labs and imaging are available, I need to review the complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, coagulation studies, and the official radiology report of the CT scan to fully assess the patient's current status.  Additionally, a physical exam focusing on signs of peritonitis and hemodynamic stability is crucial.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs confirm acute cholecystitis with significantly elevated lipase and conjugated bilirubin, suggestive of gallstone pancreatitis and biliary obstruction.  The elevated INR, along with the prolonged PT and PTT, confirms coagulopathy likely due to the patient's coumadin therapy.  The leukocytosis with neutrophilia and bandemia further supports the diagnosis of acute inflammation and infection.  The patient also has a low hemoglobin and hematocrit, which could be chronic or represent acute blood loss.  Given the patient's history of hematuria, I need to assess for signs of active bleeding.  Additionally, the elevated BUN suggests potential dehydration or renal impairment.  I will request a physical exam to assess for signs of hemodynamic instability, peritonitis, and active bleeding.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, oxygen saturation), Abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation focusing on tenderness, guarding, rebound, and rigidity), Assessment of mucous membranes and skin turgor for dehydration,  Rectal exam (assess for melena or hematochezia),  Assessment for any signs of active bleeding (e.g., hematuria, bruising, petechiae)

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute cholecystitis with gallstone pancreatitis and biliary obstruction, confirmed by laboratory and imaging findings.  The physical exam reveals mild epigastric tenderness without signs of peritonitis, suggesting that the inflammation is currently localized.  The patient's coagulopathy, leukocytosis, and elevated liver enzymes indicate the need for urgent intervention.  The patient's anemia requires further investigation, but given the urgency of the biliary obstruction and pancreatitis, addressing these takes precedence.  The patient is currently hemodynamically stable and without signs of active bleeding or peritonitis.  The plan is to proceed with ERCP with appropriate reversal of coagulopathy as indicated by the elevated INR.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Cholecystitis with Gallstone Pancreatitis
2. Biliary Obstruction
3. Coumadin-induced Coagulopathy
4. Anemia (etiology unclear)
5. Acute Kidney Injury (likely pre-renal)

Treatment:
1. Reverse coagulopathy: Administer Vitamin K and consider fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) based on the urgency of the ERCP.
2. ERCP: Proceed with ERCP as soon as coagulopathy is adequately reversed to relieve biliary obstruction and address any common bile duct stones.
