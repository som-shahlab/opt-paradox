HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with history of fall and acetabular fracture treated conservatively presents with abdominal pain started around 1 am. Now localized to the RLQ. Multiple episodes of NBNB emesis. + anorexia, fevers, chills. No dysuria or testicular pain.    Past Medical History: TB, treated as child   Social History: ___ Family History: non-contributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain localized to the RLQ, with associated NBNB emesis, anorexia, fevers, and chills. This presentation is concerning for appendicitis. Given the patient's history of TB, it's important to also consider other infectious etiologies such as psoas abscess.  A physical exam is necessary to evaluate for peritoneal signs and assess for tenderness in the RLQ.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Abdominal exam to assess for tenderness, guarding, rebound, rigidity, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign, Murphy's sign;  Vital signs including temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate

ToolMessage:
"Vitals:  99  82  122/59  16  98 RA GEN: A&Ox3, NAD HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist CV: RRR ABD: Soft, nondistended, TTP RLQ Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of RLQ pain, NBNB emesis, anorexia, fevers, chills, and RLQ tenderness suggests appendicitis.  The absence of rebound tenderness, guarding, or rigidity lowers the likelihood of a perforated appendix, but does not rule it out.  Given the history of TB, a psoas abscess should still be considered. Lab tests are needed to assess for leukocytosis and other signs of infection. Imaging may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, UA, CRP, ESR

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation is highly suspicious for appendicitis despite the relatively normal lab values and lack of significant findings on physical exam other than RLQ tenderness.  Imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for other potential causes of abdominal pain.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found a matching CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT abdomen pelvis.  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 358 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Previously seen opacities at the lung bases are resolved. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion. The visualized heart is normal in size.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix measures 7 mm, borderline enlarged in size, and is mostly fluid-filled. The wall appears slightly hyperemic. Although there are several foci of gas within the appendix, the findings are concerning for early ____.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The reproductive organs are unremarkable.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. Mild atherosclerotic disease is noted.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture. There is lumbarization of S1 with a pseudoarticulation on the right.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with RLQ pain, NBNB emesis, anorexia, fevers, and chills. Physical exam revealed RLQ tenderness.  Labs were relatively unremarkable.  CT scan shows a borderline enlarged appendix measuring 7mm, mostly fluid-filled with a slightly hyperemic wall and concerning for early appendicitis.  The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and CT findings are consistent with early appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with classic symptoms of appendicitis (RLQ pain, NBNB emesis, anorexia, fevers, and chills). While the initial labs were unremarkable and the physical exam only revealed RLQ tenderness, the CT scan confirms the diagnosis, showing a borderline enlarged appendix with hyperemic walls and fluid filling, concerning for early appendicitis.  The presence of gas within the appendix is not typical for acute appendicitis and could suggest alternative diagnoses, but given the other findings, appendicitis remains the most likely diagnosis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Appendicitis
2. Psoas abscess (less likely given CT findings)
3. Mesenteric adenitis (less likely given CT findings)
4. Gastroenteritis (less likely given localized RLQ pain and CT findings)
5. Urinary tract infection (less likely given lack of urinary symptoms and normal UA)

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment for appendicitis.  Given the early stage of appendicitis, a laparoscopic approach is preferred.  The patient should be started on IV fluids, antibiotics (covering gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria), and pain medication.  Post-operative care should include monitoring for complications such as infection, bleeding, and ileus.  The patient should be advised to avoid strenuous activity for several weeks following surgery.
