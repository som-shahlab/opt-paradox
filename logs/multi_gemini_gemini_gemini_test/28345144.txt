HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ y/o M c/o of midepigastric pain. Onset ___ at noon, worsened by vomiting and increase pain that ___ him to the  ER. No leukocytosis or fevers at the time and was discharge with Dx of gastroenteritis the patient returns this morning at 9:00am with radiation of the pain to the RLQ. Reports some sweating and increase abdominal pain.     Past Medical History: None   Social History: ___ Family History: No h/o crohn's


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with mid-epigastric pain that has migrated to the RLQ, concerning for appendicitis.  Given the worsening symptoms, lack of leukocytosis doesn't rule out appendicitis. I need more information to assess the patient's current condition and rule out other potential causes.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Psoas sign, Obturator sign,  rebound tenderness, Murphy's sign,  vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate)

ToolMessage:
"98.9 98.4 64 121/65 18 98RA AAOX3 NAD RRR CTAB Soft, appropriately tender, mildly distended. Incision CDI with staples"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with migrating pain, now localized to the RLQ, along with tenderness, and slightly elevated temperature raises strong suspicion for appendicitis. While the previous lack of leukocytosis was noted, it's not definitive in ruling out appendicitis, especially with the evolving clinical picture. The physical exam findings, including tenderness and mild distension, further support this.  I will order a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for any complications.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast report. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Helical axial MDCT images were obtained from the bases of the lungs to the pubic symphysis after the administration of IV contrast. Reformatted images in coronal and sagittal axes were generated. DLP: 369.42 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: The bases of the lungs are clear. There is no pleural or pericardial effusion.  CT abdomen: The appendix is visualized within the pelvis. It is fluid filled and dilated, measuring 1.3 cm, with a hyperenhancing wall. No abscess is seen. There is a moderate amount of intraperitoneal and pelvic free fluid with enhancement of the peritoneum in the right lower quadrant. No extraluminal air or discontinuity of the appendix wall is definitely identified to suggest perforation. The stomach and small bowel are decompressed and fluid filled. The large bowel contains fecalized material and air.  The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesion or intrahepatic biliary duct dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits without wall thickening or pericholecystic fluid. The spleen is homogeneous and normal in size. The pancreas is without focal lesions or peripancreatic fluid stranding or fluid collection. The adrenal glands are unremarkable. The kidneys are without focal lesion, demonstrate symmetric nephrograms, and excrete contrast promptly. The intra-abdominal vasculature is unremarkable. No retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria. No abdominal wall hernia is seen.  CT pelvis: The urinary bladder is within normal limits. As mentioned above, there is a moderate amount of pelvic free fluid. No pelvic wall or inguinal lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria is seen.  Osseous structures: No blastic or lytic lesions suspicious for malignancy present."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and the CT scan confirming a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with a hyperenhancing wall and surrounding free fluid solidify the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The absence of extraluminal air or discontinuity suggests no perforation at this time.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, including migrating pain, RLQ tenderness, and the CT findings of a dilated, fluid-filled appendix with a hyperenhancing wall and periappendiceal free fluid, confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.  The absence of extraluminal air or discontinuity of the appendix wall suggests that it is not perforated at this time.  The moderate amount of free fluid suggests inflammation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Epiploic Appendagitis
3. Mesenteric Adenitis
4. Cecal Diverticulitis
5. Gastroenteritis

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy.  Given the presence of free fluid and inflammation, a laparoscopic approach is preferred.  Pre-operatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole).  Post-operatively, the patient should receive pain management, continue antibiotics until afebrile and tolerating a regular diet, and have close follow-up to monitor for any complications such as surgical site infection or intra-abdominal abscess.
