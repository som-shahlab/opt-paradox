HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ with onset of right sided abdominal pain since ___, 2  days prior to consultation.  She reports pain with nausea but  without emesis.  She also notes that she has had diarrhea,  chills and sweats, but has not had fevers.  She reports mild  pain that is similar to this presentation on several prior  episodes but this occasion was much more severe.  She denies any  history of recent weight loss.  She is on Dalteparin for history  of pulmonary embolism.  She currently takes that medication  every other day.    Past Medical History: PMH: Hypercholesterolemia  Hypothyroidism  Colonic adenoma  Osteoporosis  Hypertension  Overweight  Endometrial cancer  Neuropathy  Pneumonia due to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus  Empyema lung  Infection due to strongyloides  Pulmonary embolism  Chronic kidney disease (CKD), stage III (moderate)  Pancytopenia  Radiation cystitis     Social History: ___ Family History: noncontributory


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with right-sided abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, chills, and sweats.  Given her history of pulmonary embolism (PE) and current use of Dalteparin, it's crucial to rule out complications like recurrent PE or bleeding.  The abdominal pain could have various causes, including appendicitis, cholecystitis, or diverticulitis. Her history of endometrial cancer raises concerns about potential recurrence or metastasis.  Infectious causes are also possible given the chills and sweats.  A thorough evaluation is needed to determine the cause of her symptoms.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs show an elevated white blood cell count with neutrophilia, suggesting an infectious process.  Elevated AST and ALT indicate possible liver involvement, although lipase is normal, making pancreatitis less likely.  The elevated creatinine suggests some level of kidney dysfunction, consistent with her history of chronic kidney disease.  The slightly low albumin could be due to inflammation or malnutrition.  The lack of D-dimer and coagulation studies makes it difficult to assess her risk of recurrent PE or bleeding complications.  Abdominal imaging is needed to further evaluate the right-sided abdominal pain and potential liver involvement.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST  TECHNIQUE: Helical axial MDCT images were obtained from the bases of the lungs through the pubic symphysis, after the administration of IV contrast. Reformatted images in coronal and sagittal axes were generated. DLP: 652.9 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS: There is atelectasis at the lung bases bilaterally, right greater than left. No pleural or pericardial effusion is seen.  LIVER: The liver enhances homogeneously without focal lesion or intrahepatic biliary duct dilation. The portal vein is patent.The gallbladder is moderately distended, with mild wall edema and surrounding fat stranding. Locules of gas are seen within the lumen.  SPLEEN: The spleen is homogeneous and normal in size.  PANCREAS: The pancreas is without peripancreatic stranding or fluid collection. Tiny hypodensities in the pancreatic head are incompletely characterized.  ADRENALS: The adrenal glands are unremarkable.  KIDNEYS: The kidneys demonstrate symmetric nephrograms and excrete contrast promptly. There is no focal mass lesion or hydronephrosis.  GI: The stomach is decompressed, but there is no obvious intraluminal mass or wall thickening.The small and large bowel are within normal limits, without wall thickening or evidence of obstruction.There is extensive colonic diverticulosis without evidence of diverticulitis.  RETROPERITONEUM: The aorta is normal in caliber, with mild atherosclerotic calcifications.There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria.  CT PELVIS: The urinary bladder appears normal.No pelvic wall or inguinal lymph node enlargement by CT size criteria is seen.There is no pelvic free fluid.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No focal lesion suspicious for malignancy present. A compression fracture of the L4 vertebral body is of unknown chronicity. There is mild retrolisthesis at this level."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's CT scan reveals a moderately distended gallbladder with mild wall edema, surrounding fat stranding, and intraluminal gas, highly suggestive of cholecystitis.  While the patient hasn't reported fever, the combination of right-sided abdominal pain, nausea, chills, sweats, and these CT findings points towards acute cholecystitis as the likely diagnosis.  The elevated WBC count and neutrophils further support this.  The other findings, such as atelectasis and diverticulosis, are less likely to be contributing to her current symptoms.  The patient's history of PE and current anticoagulant use require careful consideration for potential complications, but the current presentation is most consistent with cholecystitis.
