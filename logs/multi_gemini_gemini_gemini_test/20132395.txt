Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ is a ___ male with opioid use disorder on Suboxone, HCV, and recent h/o bilateral iliac artery  occlusion s/p aorto-bifem bypass (___) who presented to ___ with constant, worsening abdominal pain and was transferred to ___ after he was found to have a possible pancreatic pseudocysts on CT imaging.  After the bypass in ___, he started to have intermittent  sharp epigastric pain that was mild but would last for a day or two.  It did not seem to be associated with eating/drinking. Nothing seemed to make the pain worse. He thought it was pain from his bowels because it was similar to pain he experienced when he had an ileus in the past. Over the past few months, the pain has  been growing more severe. About 3 days ago, he developed a very  severe episode of epigastric abdominal pain that has been radiating to the LUQ and has been constant since onset. Yesterday he was nauseated and vomited ___ times (the first episode was dark brown; subsequent episodes were clear/yellow; no blood). He was not able to keep anything down yesterday - even sips of water. The last time he ate anything was ___ night when he had a BLT, pickles, and some chips.  He has been having formed, brown bowel movements daily however has not had a bowel movement in about 4 days. He does not feel constipated.  No fevers/chills. No lightheadedness or dizziness. No chest  pain. He feels like he can't take a deep breath due to abdominal pain but he does not feel short of breath. No coughing. He has mild nausea currently. No dysuria.   ED COURSE: VS: Tmax 98.3, HR ___, BP 150s-160s/80s-90s, RR ___, SpO2 97-99% on RA Exam: "left upper quadrant/epigastric tenderness without rebound or guarding" Labs: WBC 17, ALP 135, lipase 74, lactate 1.5 Imaging: CT abd/pelvis from OSH, RUQ US showing loculated fluid collection at the pancreatic tail Consultants: GI/Pancreas - NPO, IV fluids, IV pain meds,  continue ___ review imaging with radiology to consider ___ drainage Interventions: hydromorphone 1 mg IV x2, ondansetron 4 mg IV x1, Zosyn 4.5 g x1, vancomycin 1000mg IV x1    Past Medical History:  - Opioid use disorder on Suboxone  - Chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy s/p spinal cord stimulator  - Chronic HCV s/p Harvoni  - Tobacco use disorder  - H/o bilateral iliac artery occlusion s/p aorto-bifem bypass (___)    Social History: ___ Family History: FAMILY HISTORY:  No family history of aortic disease or sudden death

Thought: The patient's presentation with severe epigastric pain radiating to the LUQ, nausea, vomiting, and a history of opioid use disorder raises concerns for several possible diagnoses, including pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, bowel obstruction, or other intra-abdominal pathology.  The previous CT scan suggesting a pancreatic pseudocyst needs further evaluation.  Given the elevated white blood cell count and the patient's history of recent vascular surgery, it's important to rule out infectious and ischemic causes. I need more information about the patient's current condition and the characteristics of the fluid collection.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast, MRI of the abdomen with MRCP

ToolMessage:
"Here is the CT Abdomen and Pelvis with Contrast report from the available studies:  EXAMINATION: CT ABD AND PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  TECHNIQUE: Pre and post contrast with split bolus: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis prior to and following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Oral contrast was administered. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS.  DOSE: Acquisition sequence: 1) Spiral Acquisition 5.2 s, 33.9 cm; CTDIvol = 17.5 mGy (Body) DLP = 583.3 mGy-cm. 2) Spiral Acquisition 5.6 s, 36.4 cm; CTDIvol = 21.1 mGy (Body) DLP = 755.6 mGy-cm. 3) Sequenced Acquisition 0.5 s, 0.2 cm; CTDIvol = 9.3 mGy (Body) DLP = 1.9 mGy-cm. 4) Stationary Acquisition 35.9 s, 0.2 cm; CTDIvol = 611.7 mGy (Body) DLP = 122.3 mGy-cm. 5) Spiral Acquisition 8.1 s, 52.9 cm; CTDIvol = 20.3 mGy (Body) DLP = 1,060.2 mGy-cm. Total DLP (Body) = 2,523 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN:  HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. There is no evidence of focal lesions. Scattered hepatic hypodensities throughout both right and left lobes are nonspecific and too small to characterize. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits.  PANCREAS: There is interval increase in size of a rim enhancing lobulated fluid collection arising around the pancreatic body and tail and extending along the splenic hilum measuring at least 12.7 x 8.0 x 6.7 cm, previously measuring 11.2 x 7.1 x 6.0 cm. Additional areas of fluid located near the gastric fundus (8:14) and posterior to the spleen (8, 17), are likely contiguous with the main lobulated fluid collection. Adjacent to stranding around the pancreatic body and tail as well as within the gastrosplenic ligament is revision lysed. There are no new fluid collections. The pancreatic head and neck are somewhat atrophic.  SPLEEN: New patchy hypodensities within the spleen likely reflect the splenic infarcts. The splenic vein is markedly attenuated as it traverses posterior to the pancreatic body and tail. The splenic artery is patent.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable apart from the pancreatic collection abutting the gastric wall (8:20). Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is normal.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder is decompressed. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: The prostate is mildly enlarged.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: The patient is post aorto bi femoral bypass which appears unremarkable. A small amount of stranding and fluid is seen around the inguinal regions bilaterally, likely related to postoperative change. The portal vein, SMV and IVC are patent.  BONES: A neurostimulator device is present. Multilevel degenerative changes are seen in the lumbar spine.  SOFT TISSUES: There is a small umbilical hernia containing fat. A midline laparotomy scar is also noted.  The requested MRI of the abdomen with MRCP is not available in the provided imaging studies."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast shows an interval increase in the size of the rim-enhancing lobulated fluid collection around the pancreatic body and tail, consistent with a growing pancreatic pseudocyst.  The presence of splenic infarcts and an attenuated splenic vein suggests possible vascular compromise to the spleen, which could be related to the pseudocyst or other underlying processes. The patient's ongoing pain, nausea, and inability to tolerate oral intake warrant intervention. While the current imaging doesn't provide a definitive diagnosis for the cause of the pseudocyst, the clinical picture points towards a need for drainage.
