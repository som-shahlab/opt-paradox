HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ is a ___ w/ Afib on Coumadin, mastocytosis, and hx  of TBI who is presenting here to the ED w/ diffuse upper abd  pain and n/v that started after eating yesterday. She had a  salad from ___ after which she has had multiple episodes of  vomiting as well as upper abd pain. She says she has never had  similar sx before. Labs show WBC 12.4, AP 145, and Tbili 1.9  (direct 0.3). A RUQ U/S showed cholelithiasis and CBD diam ~8mm.  We were consulted for further management. A CT A/P was then  obtained which showed an enhancing GB wall w/ mild  pericholecystic fluid.   Past Medical History: OB History: G1P1, SVD x 1, 7 lb 6 oz, complicated by pre-eclampsia  GYN History: - Menopausal for > ___ years - History of postmenopausal bleeding - History of fibroids, most recently seen on pelvic ultrasound ___ as detailed above - History of postmenopausal bleeding spotting, had prior D&C in ___ with benign pathology. - No history of abnormal Pap smears  Past Medical History: - atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin, managed by Dr. ___ - hypertension - history of central retinal vein occlusion - glucose intolerance - obesity, BMI 49 - OSA, uses CPAP at home - hypercholesterolemia - h/o colonic adenoma, getting ___ year follow-up colonoscopy - history of TBI after care accident in 1990s, reports some difficulties with short-term memory, independent in ADLs  Past Surgical History: - breast mass biopsy - D&C   Social History: ___ Family History: Ms. ___ reports a strong family history of atrial fibrillation  (seven out of fourteen siblings, have been tested at ___ for  possible genetic link). Several siblings have had melanoma. One  brother had testicular cancer as well as brain cancer (?  metastatic versus second primary). Another sibling with sarcoma  requiring leg amputation. No family history of breast, ovarian,  uterine, cervical, or colon cancer.


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and vomiting after eating, concerning for biliary pathology.  Her elevated total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase, along with ultrasound findings of cholelithiasis and a dilated common bile duct, suggest possible choledocholithiasis or acute cholangitis. The enhancing gallbladder wall on CT is concerning for cholecystitis. Given her age and comorbidities, including being on Coumadin, it's important to assess her coagulation status and risk for bleeding complications before considering any interventions.  Additionally, her history of mastocytosis could be contributing to her symptoms, and needs to be considered.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: This patient is presenting with a picture consistent with acute cholecystitis, likely with choledocholithiasis given the elevated bilirubin and dilated common bile duct. Her INR is elevated, likely due to her Coumadin therapy for atrial fibrillation.  While her lipase is normal, her elevated alk phos and bilirubin in conjunction with the imaging findings support a biliary pathology rather than pancreatitis. Her elevated monocytes may be related to her mastocytosis.  I have enough information to recommend a course of action.
Action: done
