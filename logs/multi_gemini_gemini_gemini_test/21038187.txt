HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
___ y/p male presents with focal abdominal pain that began around 8AM this morning. He describes the pain as dull,  moderate, and localized to the RLQ. Shortly after the pain started he  began to have nausea and vomited twice. There was no frank blood in  the emesis. He denies radiation of pain. He denied any positions  that alleviated or worsened pain. He reports having a mild appetite. He endorses subjective fevers but no night sweats or chills. He also denied any recent URI sxs, UTI sxs, sick contacts or eating at new restaurant.  ROS: (+) per HPI (-) Denies chills, night sweats, unexplained weight loss, fatigue/malaise/lethargy, changes in appetite, trouble  with sleep, pruritus, jaundice, rashes, bleeding, easy bruising, headache, dizziness, vertigo, syncope, weakness, paresthesias, hematemesis, bloating, cramping, melena, BRBPR, dysphagia, chest pain, shortness of breath, cough, edema,  urinary frequency, urgency    Past Medical History: No reported past medical history  Right Hip surgery Left Knee orthoscopic surgery Medications: Claritin and Mucinex    Social History: ___ Family History: Father died from prostate cancer otherwise no other hx of malignancy


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of focal RLQ pain, nausea, vomiting, and subjective fevers raises suspicion for appendicitis.  However, other diagnoses such as mesenteric adenitis, gastroenteritis, or even a kidney stone need to be considered.  A physical exam, laboratory tests, and imaging studies are needed to narrow the differential diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, abdominal exam (including palpation for tenderness, rebound tenderness, guarding, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign),  auscultation of bowel sounds

ToolMessage:
"On admission:   Vitals: 98  88 130/75 sat at 100% RA  GEN: A&O X3, NAD mild discomfort with movement HEENT: No scleral icterus, mucus membranes moist and OP clear CV: RRR, No M/G/R PULM: Clear to auscultation b/l, No W/R/R ABD: Soft, nondistended, positive McBurney's no Rovsing sign, Negative psoas or Obturator sign, no guarding, normoactive bowel sounds, no palpable masses. Ext: No ___ edema, ___ warm and well perfused"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The physical exam findings of McBurney's point tenderness with normoactive bowel sounds and absence of guarding further increases the suspicion for appendicitis.  Laboratory tests are needed to assess for signs of infection and other abnormalities.
Action: laboratory tests
Action Input: CBC with differential, CMP, urinalysis, CRP

ToolMessage:
"I'll help you organize the results for the requested tests:  CBC with differential: - White Blood Cells: 14.2 K/uL - Hemoglobin: 17.2 g/dL - Hematocrit: 49.8% - Platelet Count: 253.0 K/uL - Red Blood Cells: 5.55 m/uL - MCV: 90.0 fL - MCH: 31.0 pg - MCHC: 34.5% - RDW: 12.6% Differential: - Neutrophils: 86.4% - Lymphocytes: 8.6% - Monocytes: 4.0% - Eosinophils: 0.8% - Basophils: 0.2%  CMP (Comprehensive Metabolic Panel): - Sodium: 138.0 mEq/L - Potassium: 4.1 mEq/L - Chloride: 102.0 mEq/L - Bicarbonate: 21.0 mEq/L - Glucose: Negative - Urea Nitrogen: 11.0 mg/dL - Creatinine: 0.9 mg/dL - Albumin: 4.2 g/dL - Total Bilirubin: 0.7 mg/dL - Alkaline Phosphatase: 50.0 IU/L - AST: 25.0 IU/L - ALT: 22.0 IU/L  Urinalysis: - Color: Yellow - Appearance: Hazy - Specific Gravity: 1.015 - pH: 8.5 units - Protein: Negative - Glucose: Negative - Ketones: 80.0 mg/dL - Blood: Negative - Leukocytes: Negative - Nitrite: Negative - Urobilinogen: Negative - Bilirubin: Negative  CRP (C-Reactive Protein): Not available in the provided results"

}


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, and elevated white blood cell count and neutrophils are highly suggestive of appendicitis.  The elevated ketones in the urine may indicate dehydration secondary to vomiting or decreased oral intake.  Imaging is needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast study. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired contiguous images through the abdomen and pelvis were obtained with intravenous and oral contrast at 5-mm slice thickness. Coronally and sagittally reformatted images were displayed.  FINDINGS:  CT OF THE ABDOMEN: Bibasilar dependent atelectasis is noted. Otherwise, imaged lung bases are clear. There is no pleural effusion. The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion. The liver demonstrates homogeneous attenuation. No focal hepatic lesion is seen. There is no evidence of intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The hepatic vasculature is patent. The gallbladder is mildly distended without gallbladder wall edema or pericholecystic fluid collection to suggest acute inflammation. No calcified gallstones are seen. Spleen is unremarkable. Pancreas is of homogeneous enhancement without ductal dilatation or peripancreatic fluid collection. The adrenal glands are normal. Kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without evidence of hydronephrosis or renal masses. Appendix appears dilated measuring up to 10 mm with hyperemic wall. Appendix appears fluid filled. There is associated periappendiceal fat stranding. There is no evidence of appendiceal rupture or periappendiceal abscess formation at this time. Otherwise, small and large bowel loops are normal in caliber without evidence of bowel wall thickening or obstruction. There is no free air or free fluid within the abdomen. There is a 2.3 x 1.9 cm mesenteric soft tissue density lesion (3:48).  CT OF THE PELVIS: The bladder, distal ureters, prostate, seminal vesicles, rectum and sigmoid colon are unremarkable. There is no free air or free fluid within the pelvis. No pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes are seen. Three cannulated screws are seen transfixing the right femoral head and neck. There is no evidence of hardware-related complications.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesion is seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, elevated white blood cell count, and the CT findings of a dilated appendix with hyperemic wall and periappendiceal fat stranding confirm the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. The incidental mesenteric soft tissue density lesion should be noted and followed up on.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:

The mesenteric soft tissue density lesion noted on CT requires further evaluation and follow-up but is not likely related to the current presentation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis

5. Ovarian Cyst (less likely given patient is male)

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment for acute appendicitis.  This can be performed laparoscopically or via an open procedure.  The patient should be given IV fluids for rehydration and broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria.  Pain management should be provided with opioid analgesics.
