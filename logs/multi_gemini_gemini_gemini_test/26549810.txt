HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
HPI: ___ acute onset RUQ pain since 1800 day of presentation progressively worse, now radiating to back. First episode. Nausea, no emesis. Denies fevers or chills. Denies unintentional weight loss, jaundice, scleral icterus, tea-colored urine, pale stools.   History notable for similar presentation ___ with CT notable  for hepatic flexure diverticula which was conservatively managed. Follow-up colonoscopy ___ (OSH) demonstrating scattered sigmoid, hepatic flexure, and proximal transverse colon diverticulosis with few everted diverticula. 4 mm sessile polyp in proximal ascending colon. Polypectomy performed with cold biopsy forceps. Pathology consistent with adenoma. No interval episodes.    Past Medical History: PMH: Diverticulitis, MDD, BCC (back), Chronic Constipation, Gastritis, Esophagitis  PSH: Denies    Social History: ___ Family History: Denies liver of gallbladder disease. Mother: DM. Father: Stomach CA, CVA


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute right upper quadrant pain radiating to the back, nausea, and a history of diverticulitis. While the prior CT scan showed hepatic flexure diverticula, the current presentation could be biliary colic, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, or even a recurrence of diverticulitis. I need to gather more information to differentiate between these possibilities.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's labs are all within normal limits, which lowers the suspicion for biliary colic, cholecystitis, and pancreatitis. Given the history of diverticulitis and similar presentation, I would want to obtain imaging to assess for a recurrence.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast is not available in the list of available imaging studies. The only available study is a liver/gallbladder ultrasound."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: Given the normal labs and the lack of availability of a CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast, a liver/gallbladder ultrasound is the next best step to evaluate for biliary pathology, even though the labs are not suggestive of this.  If the ultrasound is negative, it increases the likelihood that this is a recurrence of diverticulitis, which could then be managed conservatively given the prior history.
Action: imaging
Action Input: Liver/gallbladder ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"The requested liver/gallbladder ultrasound is available. Here is the complete report for LIVER OR GALLBLADDER US (SINGLE ORGAN):  TECHNIQUE: Grayscale and color ultrasound images of the liver and gallbladder were obtained.  FINDINGS: The echogenicity of the liver is normal. There are no focal hepatic lesions. The CBD is dilated throughout its course, measuring 6 mm distally at the pancreatic head where an about 1.2 x 0.6 cm shadowing stone is seen. The pancreatic duct itself is normal in size. No stones are seen in the gallbladder; however, there is gallbladder distention, wall edema and pericholecystic fluid. There is no intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The spleen is normal, measuring 11 cm. There is no ascites."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's liver/gallbladder ultrasound shows a dilated common bile duct with a stone at the distal end near the pancreatic head, along with gallbladder distention, wall edema, and pericholecystic fluid. These findings are consistent with choledocholithiasis and cholecystitis, despite the normal liver function tests.  The patient's RUQ pain radiating to the back is likely due to these biliary findings.  While the patient has a history of diverticulitis, the ultrasound findings strongly suggest that the current presentation is biliary in nature.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Choledocholithiasis and Acute Cholecystitis
