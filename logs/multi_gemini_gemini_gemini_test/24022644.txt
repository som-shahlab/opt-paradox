HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
This patient is a ___ year old male who complains of RLQ abdominal pain. The patient developed right lower quadrant pain this morning along with nausea. He was able to eat about half as slice of pizza for lunch, but couldn't finish it.    Past Medical History: HTN, Asthma    Social History: ___ Family History: NC


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's RLQ pain, nausea, and decreased appetite suggest several possibilities, including appendicitis, mesenteric adenitis, or even a kidney stone.  I need the patient's age and social history to better assess risk factors. I also need vital signs and a physical exam to evaluate the patient's current condition.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation),  abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, palpation, percussion), tenderness to palpation in RLQ, McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, psoas sign, obturator sign, Murphy's sign

ToolMessage:
"___:    Temp: 99.0 HR: 98 BP: 148/108 Resp: 16 O(2)Sat: 98 Normal   Constitutional: Comfortable Chest: Clear to auscultation Cardiovascular: Regular Rate and Rhythm, Normal first and second heart sounds Abdominal: Soft, Nondistended, grossly obese, positive right lower quadrant tenderness with Rovsing sign. GU/Flank: No costovertebral angle tenderness Extr/Back: No cyanosis, clubbing or edema Skin: Warm and dry Neuro: Speech fluent Psych: Normal mentation  Physical examination"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's RLQ pain, nausea, decreased appetite, fever, and tenderness with positive Rovsing's sign are highly suggestive of appendicitis.  Given the patient's obesity, a CT scan would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possibilities.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: MDCT axial images were acquired through abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and submitted to PACS for review. Oral contrast was not administered.  DOSE: DLP: 920 mGy-cm (abdomen and pelvis.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN:  HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout however the overall attenuation is decreased. There is no evidence of focal lesions. There is no evidence of intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation. The gallbladder is within normal limits, without stones or gallbladder wall thickening.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of stones, focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There are no urothelial lesions in the kidneys or ureters. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness and enhancement throughout. No evidence of obstruction. The appendix is enlarged measuring up to 12 mm in diameter with surrounding fat stranding and hyper enhancing walls. The adjacent cecum is mildly edematous. No surrounding fluid collection is seen. Adjacent prominent lymph nodes are likely reactive. There is no free air.  RETROPERITONEUM: There is no evidence of retroperitoneal and mesenteric lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm. There is no calcium burden in the abdominal aorta and great abdominal arteries.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is no evidence of pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy. There is no free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: Reproductive organs are within normal limits  BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions.  NOTIFICATION: These findings were discussed with Dr. ___ by Dr. ___ at 20:40 on ___ by telephone at time of discovery."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, nausea, fever, and positive Rovsing's sign, combined with the CT findings of an enlarged appendix measuring 12mm in diameter with surrounding fat stranding and hyperenhancing walls, confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation with RLQ pain, nausea, fever, and positive Rovsing's sign, combined with the CT findings of an enlarged appendix measuring 12mm in diameter with surrounding fat stranding and hyperenhancing walls, confirms the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Mesenteric Adenitis
3. Kidney Stone
4. Constipation
5. Gastroenteritis

Treatment:  Appendectomy is the definitive treatment.  This can be performed laparoscopically or open, depending on the severity of the inflammation and surgeon preference.  Preoperatively, the patient should receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics to cover gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Cefoxitin or a combination of Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole).  Postoperatively, the patient should receive pain medication and continue antibiotics until afebrile and with a normal white blood cell count.  The patient should be monitored for complications such as abscess formation or wound infection.  A follow-up appointment should be scheduled to monitor healing and remove sutures/staples if necessary.
