HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Ms. ___ is a ___ with PMHx significant for thyroid  cancer s/p subtotal thyroidectomy who presented on ___  with 1 day of worsening abdominal pain. She stated that her pain  was originally diffuse over much of the abdomen but has become  sharp and localized to the right lower quadrant over the past 12  hours. The pain had been constant since its onset and had been  accompanied by nausea and 4 bouts of bilious emesis yesterday  night (___). She denies diarrhea, dysuria, or blood in her  vomit or stool. She felt febrile at home and was febrile in the  ED to 101.4 for which she has taken tylenol to good effect. She  tolerated a breakfast of oatmeal and crackers on ___ and her  most recent bowel movement was that morning. Since  self-presenting to the ED at approximately 1700, she developed  right-sided lower back pain.    Past Medical History: PMH:  Thyroid cancer Hashimoto's thyroiditis Osteoarthritis  PSH: Subtotal thyroidectomy -- ___, ___'s    Social History: ___ Family History: Father - AFib, ___ dz Mother - ___ retinopathy Brother - AFib ___ aunt - ___ cancer Great-aunt - ___     ADMISSION


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with acute abdominal pain localized to the right lower quadrant, with associated nausea, vomiting, and fever. This presentation is concerning for appendicitis.  Given her history of thyroid cancer and thyroidectomy, it's also important to consider other potential causes, such as bowel obstruction, ovarian pathology, or even a recurrence of her cancer. I need more information to narrow down the differential diagnosis.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, Psoas sign, Murphy's sign,  abdominal rebound tenderness, guarding, bowel sounds

ToolMessage:
"VS: T=98.4 (101.4 on presentation) BP=103/66 HR=95 RR=16  O2Sat=96%RA HEENT: NC/AT CV: RRR, no mrg, nl S1+S2 PULM: CTAB anteriorly ___: Symmetric on inspection, no surgical scars. Bellybutton  ring in place. Soft, non-distended. Tender to palpation on  right, particular focal tenderness over RLQ. No shake  tenderness. MSK: Moving all extremities normally. NEURO: A/Ox3"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's physical exam findings, including focal tenderness in the RLQ, further increase the suspicion for appendicitis.  McBurney's point tenderness, Rovsing's sign, Obturator sign, and Psoas sign were not explicitly mentioned in the physical exam results, so I will request them specifically. Additionally, laboratory tests are needed to assess for signs of infection and other potential causes of abdominal pain. Imaging may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis or identify alternative diagnoses.

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's lab results show an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift (increased bands), which is consistent with an infectious process.  The elevated neutrophils further support this. The low platelets are concerning and warrant further investigation, but are less likely to be directly related to her current abdominal pain.  The urinalysis is largely unremarkable, though the presence of ketones is notable and may be related to dehydration from vomiting or a dietary factor. The negative beta-hCG effectively rules out pregnancy.  The lipase result is still missing, and I will request that.  Given the high clinical suspicion for appendicitis, I will also request imaging to confirm the diagnosis.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"Yes, I found the matching CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast study. Here is the complete report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT):  TECHNIQUE: Single phase split bolus contrast: MDCT axial images were acquired through the abdomen and pelvis following intravenous contrast administration with split bolus technique. IV Contrast: 100 mL Omnipaque. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed and reviewed on PACS. Oral contrast was not administered. DOSE: Total DLP (Body) = 326 mGy-cm.  FINDINGS:  LOWER CHEST: Visualized lung fields are within normal limits. There is no evidence of pleural or pericardial effusion.  ABDOMEN: HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation throughout. Multiple hypodensities throughout the liver, the largest measuring up to 1.4 cm in the right lobe likely represent cysts or hamartomas. There is mild periportal edema. There is no evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation. The CBD measures up to 6 mm. The gallbladder demonstrates some wall edema and a dependent radiopaque stone at the fundus.  PANCREAS: The pancreas has normal attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions or pancreatic ductal dilatation. There is no peripancreatic stranding.  SPLEEN: The spleen shows normal size and attenuation throughout, without evidence of focal lesions.  ADRENALS: The right and left adrenal glands are normal in size and shape.  URINARY: The kidneys are of normal and symmetric size with normal nephrogram. There is no evidence of focal renal lesions or hydronephrosis. There is no perinephric abnormality.  GASTROINTESTINAL: The stomach is unremarkable. 2 diverticula are noted in the third portion of the duodenum. Small bowel loops demonstrate normal caliber, wall thickness, and enhancement throughout. The colon and rectum are within normal limits. The appendix is fluid-filled and measures up to 8 mm. There is significant fat stranding surrounding the appendix. No extraluminal air or fluid collection.  PELVIS: The urinary bladder and distal ureters are unremarkable. There is a small amount of free fluid in the pelvis.  REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS: IUD seen in the uterus.  LYMPH NODES: There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. There is no pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy.  VASCULAR: There is no abdominal aortic aneurysm.  BONES: There is no evidence of worrisome osseous lesions or acute fracture.  SOFT TISSUES: The abdominal and pelvic wall is within normal limits."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation, physical exam findings, laboratory results, and CT scan findings are consistent with acute appendicitis. The CT scan shows a fluid-filled appendix measuring 8mm with significant surrounding fat stranding, which is highly suggestive of inflammation. While the patient also has some gallstones and periportal edema, these findings are less likely to be the primary cause of her current symptoms. The elevated white blood cell count and left shift further support the diagnosis of appendicitis.  The low platelets are a separate issue that requires further investigation but is not directly related to her current presentation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
