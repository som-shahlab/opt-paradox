HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
HPI: ___ year old woman presenting with 48 hours of low mid /  left abdominal pain. She informs he pain started yesterday morning when she woke up, describes it as an increasing discomfort in  the mid to left suprapubic area. Associated nausea, dry heave,  anorexia, bloating and chills. Denies diarrhea, constipation, fever, vomiting, BRBPR or any other symptoms.  Last BM today. + Flatus. Last meal: Pretzels this pm      Past Medical History: HTN     Social History: ___ Family History: Father died of lymphoma ___. Mother family with hx of "heart problems


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: I need the patient's age and father's age of lymphoma diagnosis to assess risk factors.  The location and nature of the abdominal pain suggest several possibilities, including ovarian cysts, diverticulitis, or even appendicitis (though less likely given the location).  Given the nausea, anorexia, and chills, an infectious process is possible. I need to perform a physical exam to assess for tenderness, guarding, and other signs.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation), abdominal exam (inspection, auscultation, percussion, palpation focusing on the left lower quadrant), pelvic exam

ToolMessage:
"PHYSICAL EXAMINATION upon admission ___   Temp: 98.7 HR: 72 BP: 138/75 Resp: 16 O(2)Sat: 100 room air Normal   Constitutional: Comfortable HEENT: Extraocular muscles intact, Pupils equal, round and reactive to light Mucous membranes moist Chest: Clear to auscultation Cardiovascular: Normal first and second heart sounds without murmur Abdominal: The abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds. There is moderate tenderness suprapubic and just to the right of the suprapubic region. She does have mild rebound tenderness. GU/Flank: No costovertebral angle tenderness Extr/Back: No edema or calf tenderness Neuro: Speech fluent Psych: Normal mood, Normal mentation"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient presents with left lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia, bloating, and chills. The physical exam reveals moderate suprapubic tenderness with mild rebound tenderness, suggesting peritoneal irritation.  While the last bowel movement was today, the anorexia, nausea, and tenderness raise concern for an infectious or inflammatory process like diverticulitis or appendicitis (even though the location is atypical).  Ovarian pathology is also a possibility. I need imaging to further evaluate.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast

ToolMessage:
"The requested CT abdomen and pelvis with IV contrast is available. Here is the full report:  CT ABD & PELVIS WITH CONTRAST (CT)  TECHNIQUE: MDCT-acquired 5-mm axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained following the uneventful administration of 130 cc of intravenous contrast. Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed at 5-mm slice thickness.  CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Included views of the lung bases demonstrate minimal atelectasis. There is no pericardial or pleural effusion. The heart size is normal.  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, and intra-abdominal loops of small bowel are normal. There is no mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, and no free air.  CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST: The appendix is fluid filled and abnormally enlarged, measuring up to 12 mm in diameter, with wall thickening and hyperemia, compatible with acute ____. The cecum is normal. There is a small amount of fluid within the right aspect of the pelvis (2:60), which may be a small focus of free fluid or less likely right hydrosalpinx, but small bowel which is hard to delineate. The uterus is normal. A 2.6 x 2.4 cm cystic structure within the left aspect of the pelvis (2:55) is probably ovarian in origin. There is no free air. The urinary bladder is normal.  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: There is no acute fracture. No concerning blastic or lytic lesions are identified."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is a ___ year old female presenting with left lower quadrant pain, nausea, anorexia, bloating, and chills.  Physical exam revealed moderate suprapubic tenderness with mild rebound tenderness.  CT scan confirms acute appendicitis. The cystic structure in the left pelvis is likely an incidental ovarian cyst and not the cause of her current symptoms.  Given the patient's presentation and the CT findings, I would proceed with surgical consultation for appendectomy.
Action: done
Action Input: ""

DiagnosisMessage:
Thought: The patient's presentation of left lower quadrant pain, nausea, anorexia, and chills, along with physical exam findings of suprapubic tenderness and rebound tenderness, initially suggested several possibilities, including diverticulitis, appendicitis, or ovarian pathology. The CT scan definitively shows an enlarged appendix with wall thickening and hyperemia, consistent with acute appendicitis. The small amount of pelvic free fluid further supports this diagnosis. The incidentally noted ovarian cyst is likely unrelated to the current presentation.

**Final Diagnosis (ranked):**
1. Acute Appendicitis
2. Ovarian Cyst (incidental)
3. Diverticulitis
4. Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
5. Gastroenteritis

Treatment:  The patient requires an appendectomy.  Given the imaging findings and clinical presentation, a laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred approach.  Pre-operatively, the patient should be given intravenous fluids and antibiotics with coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria (e.g., cefoxitin, ertapenem, or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole).  Post-operatively, the patient should receive pain management, continue antibiotics as indicated, and be monitored for complications such as infection or abscess formation.  The patient should be advised to follow up with her physician for wound care and to discuss the incidentally noted ovarian cyst.
