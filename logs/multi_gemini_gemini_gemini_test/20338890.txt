HumanMessage:
Consider the following case and perform your task by thinking, planning, and using the aforementioned tools and format.

Patient History:
Patient is a ___ yo ___ speaking F with history of gastric  MALT, presenting with epigastric/RUQ abdominal and mid-back pain  x3-4 days.  The epigastic/RUQ abdominal pain is worse after  eating and abates between meals. She denies nausea, vomiting,  diarrhea, fevers.      Past Medical History: gastric MALT treated with radiation, HTN, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis PSH: TAH/BSO for fibroids, abdominoplasty, ___ breast reduction, operations for R hand contractures s/p MVA   Social History: ___ Family History: no known cancers


InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient is presenting with epigastric/RUQ abdominal and mid-back pain, which is concerning given her history of gastric MALT. While the pain pattern suggests a possible biliary or pancreatic etiology, it's crucial to rule out recurrence or complications related to her prior gastric MALT.  Additionally, information about her age, primary language (besides speaking English as denoted by "F"), and the type of breast reduction she underwent is missing and may be relevant.  I need more information about the patient's current medications and allergies before proceeding.
Action: physical examination
Action Input: Vital signs, complete abdominal exam, Murphy's sign, palpation for abdominal masses, tenderness, costovertebral angle tenderness

ToolMessage:
"VS: 97.6 97.2 63 122/80 18 96RA GA: alert and oriented, no acute distress HEENT: ___, normal extraocular movements, MMM Pulm: CTAB Card: RRR Abd: soft, non-distended, non-tender, no HSM Ext: warm, no edema"

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The patient's vital signs are stable and the physical exam doesn't reveal any immediate red flags like acute abdomen or overt signs of infection. However, the lack of tenderness on abdominal exam despite significant pain is somewhat unusual and warrants further investigation. The absence of information regarding the patient's age, primary language, type of breast reduction, current medications, and allergies still hinders a complete assessment.  Given the location of pain and history of gastric MALT, imaging is necessary to evaluate for potential gastrointestinal or hepatobiliary pathology.
Action: imaging
Action Input: CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast, RUQ ultrasound

ToolMessage:
"Let me provide the CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast report from the available studies:  CT ABDOMEN W/CONTRAST (CT): TECHNIQUE: CT abdomen and pelvis with IV and oral contrast.  FINDINGS: There is no focal lung consolidation or pleural effusion at the lung bases. There is no pericardial effusion. The liver enhances homogeneously, and there is no evidence of extra- or intra-hepatic biliary duct dilatation. There is a moderate amount of gallbladder wall edema; however, there is no significant fat stranding. Pancreas appears unremarkable. Adrenal glands appear normal. The kidneys enhance symmetrically, and excrete contrast symmetrically with no evidence of hydronephrosis. There is no evidence of bowel obstruction. There is no evidence of bowel perforation. There is no evidence of free air. There is no free fluid. The apperance of the stomach is nonspecific on CT, in keeping with patient diagnosis. No lymphadenopathy in the retroperitoneum or mesentery according to CT size criteria. Appendix is seen and appears normal, image (2:60).  CT PELVIS: Rectum, sigmoid, and urinary bladder appear within normal limits. No free fluid in the pelvis. No lymphadenopathy in the pelvis. There are bilateral lymph nodes in the inguinal areas; however, nonspecific, could be reactive. There is a nonspecific calcification in the right gluteal area, (2:47).  OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: Degenerative changes in thoracolumbar spine, worse at level L4-L5 and L5-S1. No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions are seen."

InfoGatheringMessage:
Thought: The CT scan reveals gallbladder wall edema but no other significant findings to explain the patient's pain.  The degenerative changes in the thoracolumbar spine could be contributing to the back pain, but the abdominal pain remains unexplained.  The lack of information about the patient's age, primary language, type of breast reduction, current medications, and allergies is still a significant gap. However, given the negative CT findings and the pain pattern, I suspect a functional or motility issue might be contributing to the patient's symptoms.  While further investigation might be warranted depending on the missing information, I'm ready to provide a preliminary assessment.
