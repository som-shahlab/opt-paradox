# src/evals/treatment_mappings.py

"""
Static definitions and file-based utilities for procedure evaluation:

- ICD code → name mappings and converters (ICD9 ↔ ICD10)
- Lists of valid procedure codes, titles, and keywords for each pathology:
    • Appendicitis (appendectomy)
    • Cholecystitis (cholecystectomy)
    • Pancreatitis (drainage procedures)
    • Diverticulitis (colectomy, drainage)
- Alternate keyword sets for fuzzy matching of model-reported procedures

These definitions drive the treatment evaluator to check whether the model
requested appropriate interventions according to clinical guidelines.
